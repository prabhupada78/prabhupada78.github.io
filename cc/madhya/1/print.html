<p>In this way they delivered all rascals and fallen souls.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Srinivasa Acarya has sung:</p>
<p>nana-sastra-vicaranaika-nipunau sad-dharma-samsthapakau</p>
<p>lokanam hita-karinau tri-bhuvane manyau saranyakarau</p>
<p>radha-krsna-padaravinda-bhajananandena mattalikau</p>
<p>vande rupa-sanatanau raghu-yugau sri-jiva-gopalakau The six Gosvamis, under the direction of Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Sanatana Gosvami, studied various Vedic scriptures and picked up the essence of them, the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>This means that all the Gosvamis wrote many scriptures on devotional service with the support of the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>Devotional service is not a sentimental activity.</p>
<p>The essence of Vedic knowledge is devotional service, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (15.15): vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah.</p>
<p>All the Vedic literature aims at understanding Krsna, and how to understand Krsna through devotional service has been explained by Srila Rupa and Sanatana Gosvamis, with evidence from all the Vedic scriptures.</p>
<p>They have put it so nicely that even a rascal or first-class fool can be delivered by devotional service under the guidance of the Gosvamis.</p>

<p>prabhu ajnaya kaila saba sastrera vicara</p>

<p>prabhu ajnaya—upon the order of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu; kaila—they did; saba sastrera—of all scriptures; vicara—analytical study; vrajera—of Sri Vrndavana-dhama; nigudha—most confidential; bhakti—devotional service; karila—did; pracara—preaching.</p>
<p>The Gosvamis carried out the preaching work of devotional service on the basis of an analytical study of all confidential Vedic scriptures.</p>
<p>This was in compliance with the order of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>Thus one can understand the most confidential devotional service of Vrndavana.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This proves that bona fide devotional service is based on the conclusions of the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>It is not based on the type of sentiment exhibited by the prakrta-sahajiyas.</p>
<p>The prakrta-sahajiyas do not consult the Vedic literature, and they are debauchees, woman-hunters and smokers of ganja.</p>
<p>Sometimes they give a theatrical performance and cry for the Lord with tears in their eyes.</p>
<p>Of course, all scriptural conclusions are washed off by these tears.</p>
<p>The prakrta-sahajiyas do not realize that they are violating the orders of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who specifically said that to understand Vrndavana and the pastimes of Vrndavana one must have sufficient knowledge of the sastras (Vedic scriptures).</p>
<p>As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.12), bhaktya sruta-grhitaya.</p>
<p>This means that devotional service is acquired from Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>Tac chraddadhanah munayah.</p>
<p>Devotees who are actually serious attain bhakti, scientific devotional service, by hearing Vedic scriptures (bhaktya sruta-grhitaya).</p>
<p>It is not that one should create something out of sentimentality, become a sahajiya and advocate such concocted devotional service.</p>
<p>However, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura considered such sahajiyas to be more favorable than the impersonalists, who are hopelessly atheistic.</p>
<p>The impersonalists have no idea of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The position of the sahajiyas is far better than that of the Mayavadi sannyasis.</p>
<p>Although the sahajiyas do not think much of Vedic knowledge, they nonetheless have accepted Lord Krsna as the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they mislead others from authentic devotional service.</p>

<p>hari-bhakti-vilasa, ara bhagavatamrta</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>hari-bhakti-vilasa—the scripture named Hari-bhakti-vilasa; ara—and; bhagavatamrta—the scripture named Brhad-bhagavatamrta; dasama-tippani—comments on the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam; ara—and; dasama-carita—poetry about the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Some of the books compiled by Srila Sanatana Gosvami were the Hari-bhakti-vilasa, Brhad-bhagavatamrta, Dasama-tippani and Dasama-carita.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the First Wave of the book known as Bhakti-ratnakara, it is said that Sanatana Gosvami understood Srimad-Bhagavatam by thorough study and explained it in his commentary known as Vaisnava-tosani All the knowledge that Sri Sanatana Gosvami and Rupa Gosvami directly acquired from Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was broadcast all over the world by their expert service.</p>
<p>Sanatana Gosvami gave his Vaisnava-tosani commentary to Srila Jiva Gosvami for editing, and Srila Jiva Gosvami edited this under the name of Laghu-tosani.</p>
<p>Whatever he immediately put down in writing was finished in the year 1476 Saka (A.D 1555).</p>
<p>Srila Jiva Gosvami completed Laghu-tosani in the year Sakabda 1504 (A.D 1583).</p>
<p>The subject matter of the Hari-bhakti-vilasa, by Sri Sanatana Gosvami, was collected by Srila Gopala Bhatta Gosvami and is known as a vaisnava-smrti.</p>
<p>This vaisnava-smrti-grantha was finished in twenty chapters, known as vilasas.</p>
<p>In the first vilasa there is a description of how a relationship is established between the spiritual master and the disciple, and mantras are explained.</p>
<p>In the second vilasa, the process of initiation is described.</p>
<p>In the third vilasa, the methods of Vaisnava behavior are given, with emphasis on cleanliness, constant remembrance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the chanting of the mantras given by the initiating spiritual master.</p>
<p>In the fourth vilasa are descriptions of samskara, the reformatory method; tilaka, the application of twelve tilakas on twelve places of the body; mudra, marks on the body; mala, chanting with beads; and guru-puja, worship of the spiritual master.</p>
<p>In the fifth vilasa, one is instructed on how to make a place to sit for meditation, and there are descriptions of breathing exercises, meditation and worship of the salagrama-sila representation of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>In the sixth vilasa, the required practices for inviting the transcendental form of the Lord and bathing Him are given.</p>
<p>In the seventh vilasa, one is instructed on how to collect flowers used for the worship of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>In the eighth vilasa, there is a description of the Deity and instructions on how to set up incense, light lamps, make offerings, dance, play music, beat drums, garland the Deity, offer prayers and obeisances and counteract offenses.</p>
<p>In the ninth vilasa, there are descriptions about collecting tulasi leaves, offering oblations to forefathers according to Vaisnava rituals, and offering food.</p>
<p>In the tenth vilasa there are descriptions of the devotees of the Lord (Vaisnavas, or saintly persons).</p>
<p>In the eleventh vilasa, there are elaborate descriptions of Deity worship and the glories of the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>One is instructed on how to chant the holy name of the Deity, and there are discussions about offenses committed while chanting the holy name, along with methods for getting relief from such offenses.</p>
<p>There are also descriptions of the glories of devotional service and the surrendering process.</p>
<p>In the twelfth vilasa, Ekadasi is described.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth vilasa, fasting is discussed, as well as observance of the Maha-dvadasi ceremony.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth vilasa, different duties for different months are outlined.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth vilasa, there are instructions on how to observe Ekadasi fasting without even drinking water.</p>
<p>There are also descriptions of branding the body with the symbols of Visnu, discussions of Caturmasya observations during the rainy season, and discussions of Janmastami, Parsvaikadasi, Sravana-dvadasi, Rama-navami and Vijaya-dasami.</p>
<p>The sixteenth vilasa discusses duties to be observed in the month of Karttika (October-November), or the Damodara month, or Urja, when lamps are offered in the Deity room or above the temple.</p>
<p>There are also descriptions of the Govardhana-puja and Ratha-yatra.</p>
<p>The seventeenth vilasa discusses preparations for Deity worship, maha-mantra chanting and the process of japa.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth vilasa the different forms of Sri Visnu are described.</p>
<p>The nineteenth vilasa discusses the establishment of the Deity and the rituals observed in bathing the Deity before installation.</p>
<p>The twentieth vilasa discusses the construction of temples, referring to those constructed by the great devotees.</p>
<p>The details of the Hari-bhakti-vilasa-grantha are given by Sri Kaviraja Gosvami in the Madhya-lila (24.329-345).</p>
<p>The descriptions given in those verses by Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami are actually a description of those portions compiled by Gopala Bhatta Gosvami.</p>
<p>According to Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, the regulative principles of devotional service compiled by Gopala Bhatta Gosvami do not strictly follow our Vaisnava principles.</p>
<p>Actually, Gopala Bhatta Gosvami collected only a summary of the elaborate descriptions of Vaisnava regulative principles from the Hari-bhakti-vilasa.</p>
<p>It is Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami’s opinion, however, that to follow the Hari-bhakti-vilasa strictly is to actually follow the Vaisnava rituals in perfect order.</p>
<p>He claims that the smarta-samaja, which is strictly followed by caste brahmanas, has influenced portions that Gopala Bhatta Gosvami collected from the original Hari-bhakti-vilasa.</p>
<p>It is therefore very difficult to find out Vaisnava directions from the book of Gopala Bhatta Gosvami.</p>
<p>It is better to consult the commentary made by Sanatana Gosvami himself for the Hari-bhakti-vilasa under the name of Dig-darsini-tika.</p>
<p>Some say that the same commentary was compiled by Gopinatha-puja Adhikari, who was engaged in the service of Sri Radha-ramanaji and who happened to be one of the disciples of Gopala Bhatta Gosvami.</p>
<p>Regarding the Brhad-bhagavatamrta, there are two parts dealing with the discharge of devotional service.</p>
<p>The first part is an analytical study of devotional service, in which there is also a description of different planets, including the earth, the heavenly planets, Brahma-loka and Vaikuntha-loka.</p>
<p>There are also descriptions of the devotees, including intimate devotees, most intimate devotees and complete devotees.</p>
<p>The second part describes the glories of the spiritual world, known as Goloka-mahatmya-nirupana, as well as the process of renunciation of the material world.</p>
<p>It also describes real knowledge, devotional service, the spiritual world, love of Godhead, attainment of life’s destination, and the bliss of the world.</p>
<p>In this way there are seven chapters in each part, fourteen chapters in all.</p>
<p>Dasama-tippani is a commentary on the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Another name for this commentary is Brhad-vaisnava-tosani-tika.</p>
<p>In the Bhakti-ratnakara, it is said that Dasama-tippani was finished in 1476 Sakabda (A.D 1555).</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati has given a description of these books.</p>
<p>The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu is a great book of instruction on how to develop devotional service to Lord Krsna and follow the transcendental process.</p>
<p>It was finished in the year 1463 Sakabda (A.D 1542).</p>
<p>This book is divided into four parts: purva-vibhaga (eastern division), daksina-vibhaga (southern division), pascima-vibhaga (western division) and uttara-vibhaga (northern division).</p>
<p>In the purva-vibhaga, there is a description of the permanent development of devotional service.</p>
<p>The general principles of devotional service, the execution of devotional service, ecstasy in devotional service and ultimately the attainment of love of Godhead are described.</p>
<p>In this way there are four laharis (waves) in this division of the ocean of the nectar of devotion.</p>
<p>In the daksina-vibhaga (southern division) there is a general description of the mellow (relationship) called bhakti-rasa, which is derived from devotional service.</p>
<p>There are also descriptions of the stages known as vibhava, anubhava, sattvika, vyabhicari and sthayi-bhava, all on this high platform of devotional service.</p>
<p>Thus there are five waves in the daksina-vibhaga division.</p>
<p>In the western division (pascima-vibhaga) there is a description of the chief transcendental humors derived from devotional service.</p>
<p>These are known as mukhya-bhakti-rasa-nirupana, or attainment of the chief humors or feelings in the execution of devotional service.</p>
<p>In that part there is a description of devotional service in neutrality, further development in love and affection (called servitude), further development in fraternity, further development in parenthood, or parental love, and finally conjugal love between Krsna and His devotees.</p>
<p>Thus there are five waves in the western division.</p>
<p>In the northern division (uttara-vibhaga) there is a description of the indirect mellows of devotional service-namely, devotional service in laughter, devotional service in wonder, and devotional service in chivalry, pity, anger, dread and ghastliness.</p>
<p>There are also mixing of mellows and the transgression of different humors.</p>
<p>Thus there are nine waves in this part.</p>
<p>This is but a brief outline of the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu.</p>
<p>The Vidagdha-madhava is a drama of Lord Krsna’s pastimes in Vrndavana.</p>
<p>Srila Rupa Gosvami finished this book in the year 1454 Sakabda (A.D 1533).</p>
<p>The first part of this drama is called venu-nada-vilasa, the second part manmatha-lekha, the third part radha-sanga, the fourth part venu-harana, the fifth part radha-prasadana, the sixth part sarad-vihara, and the seventh and last part gauri-vihara.</p>
<p>There is also a book called Ujjvala-nilamani, a transcendental account of loving affairs that includes metaphor, analogy and higher bhakti sentiments.</p>
<p>Devotional service in conjugal love is described briefly in the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, but it is very elaborately discussed in the Ujjvala-nilamani.</p>
<p>This book describes different types of lovers, their assistants, and those who are very dear to Krsna.</p>
<p>There is also a description of Srimati Radharani and other female lovers, as well as various group leaders.</p>
<p>Messengers and the constant associates, as well as others who are very dear to Krsna, are all described.</p>
<p>The book also relates how love of Krsna is awakened and describes the ecstatic situation, the devotional situation, permanent ecstasy, disturbed ecstasy, steady ecstasy, different positions of different dresses, feelings of separation, prior attraction, anger in attraction, varieties of loving affairs, separation from the beloved, meeting with the beloved, and both direct and indirect enjoyment between the lover and the beloved.</p>
<p>All this has been very elaborately described.</p>
<p>Similarly, Lalita-madhava is a description of Krsna’s pastimes in Dvaraka.</p>
<p>These pastimes were made into a drama, and the work was finished in the year 1459 Sakabda.</p>
<p>The first part deals with festivities in the evening, the second with the killing of the Sankhacuda, the third with maddened Srimati Radharani, the fourth with Radharani’s proceeding toward Krsna, the fifth with the achievement of Candravali, the sixth with the achievement of Lalita, the seventh with the meeting in Nava-vrndavana, the eighth with the enjoyment in Nava-vrndavana, the ninth with looking over pictures, and the tenth with complete satisfaction of the mind.</p>
<p>Thus the entire drama is divided into ten parts.</p>
<p>The Laghu-bhagavatamrta is divided into two parts.</p>
<p>The first is called “The Nectar of Krsna” and the second “The Nectar of Devotional Service.” The importance of Vedic evidence is stressed in the first part, and this is followed by a description of the original form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Sri Krsna and descriptions of His pastimes and expansions in svamsa (personal forms) and vibhinnamsa.</p>
<p>According to different absorptions, the incarnations are called avesa and tad-ekatma.</p>
<p>The first incarnation is divided into three purusavataras-namely, Maha-Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Ksirodakasayi Visnu.</p>
<p>Then there are the three incarnations of the modes of nature-namely, Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara (Siva).</p>
<p>All the paraphernalia used in the service of the Lord is transcendental, beyond the three qualities of this material world.</p>
<p>There is also a description of twenty-five lila-avataras, namely Catuh-sana (the Kumaras), Narada, Varaha, Matsya, Yajna, Nara-narayana Rsi, Kapila, Dattatreya, Hayagriva, Hamsa, Prsnigarbha, Rsabha, Prthu, Nrsimha, Kurma, Dhanvantari, Mohini, Vamana, Parasurama, Dasarathi, Krsna-dvaipayana, Balarama, Vasudeva, Buddha and Kalki.</p>
<p>There are also fourteen incarnations of Manu: Yajna, Vibhu, Satyasena, Hari, Vaikuntha, Ajita, Vamana, Sarvabhauma, Rsabha, Visvaksena, Dharmasetu, Sudhama, Yogesvara and Brhadbhanu.</p>
<p>There are also four incarnations for the four yugas, and their colors are described as white, red, blackish and black (sometimes yellow, as in the case of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu).</p>
<p>There are different types of millenniums and incarnations for those millenniums.</p>
<p>The categories called avesa, prabhava, vaibhava and para constitute different situations for the different incarnations.</p>
<p>According to specific pastimes, the names are spiritually empowered.</p>
<p>There are also descriptions of the difference between the powerful and the power, and the inconceivable activities of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Sri Krsna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one is greater than Him.</p>
<p>He is the source of all incarnations.</p>
<p>In the Laghu-bhagavatamrta there are descriptions of His partial incarnations, a description of the impersonal Brahman effulgence (actually the bodily effulgence of Sri Krsna), the superexcellence of Sri Krsna’s pastimes as an ordinary human being with two hands and so forth.</p>
<p>There is nothing to compare with the two-armed form of the Lord.</p>
<p>In the spiritual world (vaikuntha-jagat) there is no distinction between the owner of the body and the body itself.</p>
<p>In the material world the owner of the body is called the soul, and the body is called a material manifestation.</p>
<p>In the Vaikuntha world, however, there is no such distinction.</p>
<p>Lord Sri Krsna is unborn, and His appearance as an incarnation is perpetual.</p>
<p>Krsna’s pastimes are divided into two parts-manifest and unmanifest.</p>
<p>For example, when Krsna takes His birth within this material world, His pastimes are considered to be manifest.</p>
<p>However, when He disappears, one should not think that He is finished, for His pastimes are going on in an unmanifest form.</p>
<p>Varieties of humors, however, are enjoyed by the devotees and Lord Krsna during His manifest pastimes.</p>
<p>After all, His pastimes in Mathura, Vrndavana and Dvaraka are eternal and are going on perpetually somewhere in some part of the universe.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Bhagavata-sandarbha is also known as Sat-sandarbha.</p>
<p>In the first part, called Tattva-sandarbha, it is proved that Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most authoritative evidence directly pointing to the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>The second Sandarbha, called Bhagavat-sandarbha, draws a distinction between impersonal Brahman and localized Paramatma and describes the spiritual world and the domination of the mode of goodness devoid of contamination by the other two material modes.</p>
<p>In other words, there is a vivid description of the transcendental position known as suddha-sattva.</p>
<p>Material goodness is apt to be contaminated by the other two material qualities-ignorance and passion-but when one is situated in the suddha-sattva position, there is no chance for such contamination.</p>
<p>It is a spiritual platform of pure goodness.</p>
<p>The potency of the Supreme Lord and the living entity is also described, and there is a description of the inconceivable energies and varieties of energies of the Lord.</p>
<p>The potencies are divided into categories-internal, external, personal, marginal and so forth.</p>
<p>There are also discussions of the eternality of Deity worship, the omnipotence of the Deity, His all-pervasiveness, His giving shelter to everyone, His subtle and gross potencies, His personal manifestations, His expressions of form, quality and pastimes, His transcendental position and His complete form.</p>
<p>It is also stated that everything pertaining to the Absolute has the same potency and that the spiritual world, the associates in the spiritual world and the threefold energies of the Lord in the spiritual world are all transcendental.</p>
<p>There are further discussions concerning the difference between the impersonal Brahman and the Personality of Godhead, the fullness of the Personality of Godhead, the objective of all Vedic knowledge, the personal potencies of the Lord, and the Personality of Godhead as the original author of Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>The third Sandarbha is called Paramatma-sandarbha, and in this book there is a description of Paramatma (the Supersoul) and an explanation of how the Supersoul exists in millions and millions of living entities.</p>
<p>There are discussions of the differences between the qualitative incarnations, and discourses concerning the living entities, maya, the material world, the theory of transformation, the illusory energy, the sameness of this world and the Supersoul, and the truth about this material world.</p>
<p>In this connection, the opinions of Sridhara Svami are given.</p>
<p>It is stated that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although devoid of material qualities, superintends all material activities.</p>
<p>There is also a discussion of how the lila-avatara incarnations respond to the desires of the devotees and how the Supreme Personality of Godhead is characterized by six opulences.</p>
<p>The fourth Sandarbha is called Krsna-sandarbha, and in this book Krsna is proved to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>There are discussions of Krsna’s pastimes and qualities, His superintendence of the purusa-avataras, and so forth.</p>
<p>The opinions of Sridhara Svami are corroborated.</p>
<p>In each and every scripture, the supremacy of Krsna is stressed.</p>
<p>Baladeva, Sankarsana and other expansions of Krsna are emanations of Maha-Sankarsana.</p>
<p>All the incarnations and expansions exist simultaneously in the body of Krsna, who is described as two-handed.</p>
<p>There are also descriptions of the Goloka planet, Vrndavana (the eternal place of Krsna), the identity of Goloka and Vrndavana, the Yadavas and the cowherd boys (both eternal associates of Krsna), the adjustment and equality of the manifest and unmanifest pastimes, Sri Krsna’s manifestation in Gokula, the queens of Dvaraka as expansions of the internal potency, and, superior to them, the superexcellent gopis.</p>
<p>There is also a list of the gopis’ names and a discussion of the topmost position of Srimati Radharani.</p>
<p>The fifth Sandarbha is called Bhakti-sandarbha, and in this book there is a discussion of how devotional service can be directly executed, and how such service can be adjusted, either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>There is a discussion of the knowledge of all kinds of scripture, the establishment of the Vedic institution of varnasrama, bhakti as superior to fruitive activity, and so forth.</p>
<p>It is also stated that without devotional service even a brahmana is condemned.</p>
<p>There are discussions of the process of karma-tyaga (the giving of the results of karma to the Supreme Personality of Godhead), and the practices of mystic yoga and philosophical speculation, which are deprecated as simply hard labor.</p>
<p>Worship of the demigods is discouraged, and worship of a Vaisnava is considered exalted.</p>
<p>No respect is given to the nondevotees.</p>
<p>There are discussions of how one can be liberated even in this life (jivan-mukta), Lord Siva as a devotee, and how a bhakta and his devotional service are eternally existing.</p>
<p>It is stated that through bhakti one can attain all success because for bhakti is transcendental to the material qualities.</p>
<p>There is a discussion of how the self is manifest through bhakti.</p>
<p>There is also a discussion of the self’s bliss, as well as how bhakti, even imperfectly executed, enables one to attain the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Unmotivated devotional service is highly praised, and an explanation is given of how each devotee can achieve the platform of unmotivated service by association with other devotees.</p>
<p>There is a discussion of the differences between the maha-bhagavata and the ordinary devotee, the symptoms of philosophical speculation, the symptoms of self-worship, or ahangrahopasana, the symptoms of devotional service, the symptoms of imaginary perfection, the acceptance of regulative principles, service to the spiritual master, the maha-bhagavata (liberated devotee) and service to him, service to Vaisnavas in general, the principles of hearing, chanting, remembering and serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offenses in worship, offensive effects, prayers, engaging oneself as an eternal servant of the Lord, making friendships with the Lord and surrendering everything for His pleasure.</p>
<p>There is also a discussion of raganuga-bhakti (spontaneous love of Godhead), of the specific purpose of becoming a devotee of Lord Krsna, and a comparative study of other perfectional stages.</p>
<p>The sixth Sandarbha is called Priti-sandarbha, a thesis on love of Godhead.</p>
<p>Here it is stated that through love of Godhead, one becomes perfectly liberated and attains the highest goal of life.</p>
<p>A distinction is made between the liberated condition of a personalist and that of an impersonalist, and there is a discussion of liberation during one’s lifetime as distinguished from liberation from material bondage.</p>
<p>Of all kinds of liberation, liberation in loving service to the Lord is described as the most exalted, and meeting the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face is shown to be the highest perfection of life.</p>
<p>Immediate liberation is contrasted with liberation by a gradual process.</p>
<p>Both realization of Brahman and meeting with the Supreme Personality of Godhead are described as liberation within one’s lifetime, but meeting with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, both internally and externally, is shown to be superexcellent, above the transcendental realization of the Brahman effulgence.</p>
<p>There is a comparative study of liberation as salokya, samipya and sarupya.</p>
<p>Samipya is better than salokya.</p>
<p>Devotional service is considered to be liberation with greater facilities, and there is a discussion of how to obtain it.</p>
<p>There are also discussions of the transcendental state one achieves after attaining the devotional platform, which is the exact position of love of Godhead; the marginal symptoms of transcendental love, and how it is awakened; the distinction between so-called love and transcendental love on the platform of love of Godhead; and different types of humors and mellows enjoyed in relishing the lusty affairs of the gopis, which are different from mundane affairs, which in turn are symbolical representations of pure love for Krsna.</p>
<p>There are also discussions of bhakti mixed with philosophical speculation, the superexcellence of the love of the gopis, the difference between opulent devotional service and loving devotional service, the exalted position of the residents of Gokula, the progressively exalted position of the friends of Krsna, the gopas and the gopis in parental love with Krsna, and finally the superexcellence of the love of the gopis and that of Srimati Radharani.</p>
<p>There is also a discussion of how spiritual feelings can be present when one simply imitates them and of how such mellows are far superior to the ordinary mellows of mundane love, and there are descriptions of different ecstasies, the awakening of ecstasy, transcendental qualities, the distinction of dhirodatta, the utmost attractiveness of conjugal love, the ecstatic features, the permanent ecstatic features, the mellows divided in five transcendental features of direct loving service, and indirect loving service, considered in seven divisions.</p>
<p>Finally there is a discussion of overlapping of different rasas, and there are discussions of santa (neutrality), servitorship, taking shelter, parental love, conjugal love, direct transcendental enjoyment and enjoyment in separation, previous attraction and the glories of Srimati Radharani.</p>

<p>seita—that; parana-natha—Lord of My life; painu—I have gotten; yaha—whom; lagi’-for; madana-dahane—in the fire of lusty desire; jhuri—burning; genu—I have become “I have gotten that Lord of My life for whom I was burning in the fire of lusty desires.”</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.29.15) it is stated:</p>
<p>kamam krodham bhayam sneham</p>
<p>aikyam sauhrdam eva ca</p>
<p>nityam harau vidadhato</p>
<p>yanti tan-mayatam hi te The word kama means lusty desire, bhaya means fear, and krodha means anger.</p>
<p>If one somehow or other approaches Krsna, his life becomes successful.</p>
<p>The gopis approached Krsna with lusty desire.</p>
<p>Krsna was a very beautiful boy, and they wanted to meet and enjoy His company.</p>
<p>But this lusty desire is different from that of the material world.</p>
<p>It appears like mundane lust, but in actuality it is the highest form of attraction to Krsna.</p>
<p>Caitanya Mahaprabhu was a sannyasi; He left home and everything else.</p>
<p>He could certainly not be induced by any mundane lusty desires.</p>
<p>So when He used the word madana-dahane (“in the fire of lusty desire”), He meant that out of pure love for Krsna He was burning in the fire of separation from Krsna.</p>

<p>ei dhuya-gane nacena dvitiya prahara</p>
<p>krsna lana vraje yai--e-bhava antara</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ei dhuya-gane—in the repetition of this song; nacena—He dances; dvitiya prahara—the second period of the day; krsna lana—taking Krsna; vraje yai—let Me go back to Vrndavana; e-bhava—this ecstasy; antara—within.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu used to sing this song (seita parana-natha) especially during the latter part of the day, and He would think, “Let Me take Krsna and go back to Vrndavana.” This ecstasy was always filling His heart.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Being always absorbed in the ecstasy of Srimati Radharani, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu felt the same separation from Krsna that Srimati Radharani felt when Krsna left Vrndavana and went to Mathura.</p>
<p>This ecstatic feeling is very helpful in attaining love of God in separation.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has taught everyone that one should not be overly anxious to see the Lord, but should rather feel separation from Him in ecstasy.</p>
<p>It is actually better to feel separation from Him than to desire to see Him face to face.</p>
<p>When the gopis of Vrndavana, the residents of Gokula, met Krsna at Kuruksetra during the solar eclipse, they wanted to take Krsna back to Vrndavana.</p>
<p>Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu also felt the same ecstasy as soon as He saw Jagannatha in the temple or on the Ratha-yatra cart.</p>
<p>The gopis of Vrndavana did not like the opulence of Dvaraka.</p>
<p>They wanted to take Krsna to the village of Vrndavana and enjoy His company in the groves.</p>
<p>This desire was also felt by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and He danced in ecstasy before the Ratha-yatra festival when Lord Jagannatha went to Gundica.</p>

<p>In that ecstasy, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu recited one verse when dancing in front of Lord Jagannatha.</p>
<p>Almost no one could understand the meaning of that verse.</p>

<p>haridasa thakura ara rupa-sanatana</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>haridasa thakura—Srila Haridasa Thakura; ara—and; rupa-sanatana—Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Sanatana Gosvami; jagannatha-mandire—in the temple of Lord Jagannatha; na—not; ya’na—go; tina jana—three persons.</p>
<p>To avoid turmoil, three great personalities-Haridasa Thakura, Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Sanatana Gosvami-did not enter the temple of Jagannatha.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is still the practice at the Jagannatha temple not to allow those to enter who do not strictly follow the Vedic culture known as Hinduism.</p>
<p>Srila Haridasa Thakura, Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Sanatana Gosvami had had previous intimate connections with Muslims.</p>
<p>Haridasa Thakura had been born in a Muslim family, and Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Sanatana Gosvami, having given up their social status in Hindu society, had been appointed ministers in the Muslim government.</p>
<p>They had even changed their names to Sakara Mallika and Dabira Khasa.</p>
<p>Thus they had supposedly been expelled from brahmana society.</p>
<p>Consequently, out of humility they did not enter the temple of Jagannatha, although the personality of Godhead, Jagannatha, in His form of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, personally came to see them every day.</p>
<p>Similarly, the members of this Krsna consciousness society are sometimes refused entrance into some of the temples in India.</p>
<p>We should not feel sorry about this as long as we engage in chanting the Hare Krsna mantra.</p>
<p>Krsna Himself associates with devotees who are chanting His holy name, and there is no need to be unhappy over not being able to enter a certain temple.</p>
<p>Such dogmatic prohibitions were not approved by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>Those who were thought unfit to enter the Jagannatha temple were daily visited by Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and this indicates that Caitanya Mahaprabhu did not approve of the prohibitions.</p>
<p>To avoid unnecessary turmoil, however, these great personalities would not enter the Jagannatha temple.</p>

<p>Every day Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu used to see the upala-bhoga ceremony at the temple of Jagannatha, and after seeing this He used to go visit these three great personalities on His way to His own residence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Upala-bhoga is a particular type of offering performed just behind the Garuda-stamba on a stone slab.</p>
<p>That stone slab is called the upala.</p>
<p>All food is offered within the temple room just below the altar of Jagannatha.</p>
<p>This bhoga, however, was offered on the stone slab within the vision of the public; therefore it is called upala-bhoga.</p>

<p>After reading the verse, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu went into a ecstatic mood.</p>
<p>While He was in that state, Srila Rupa Gosvami came and immediately fell down on the floor like a rod.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word danda means rod or pole.</p>
<p>A rod or pole falls straight; similarly, when one offers obeisances to his superior with all eight angas (parts) of the body, he performs what is called dandavat.</p>
<p>Sometimes we only speak of dandavats but actually do not fall down.</p>
<p>In any case, dandavat means falling down like a rod before one’s superior.</p>

<p>We had the opportunity to receive a similar blessing from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami when we presented an essay at his birthday ceremony.</p>

<p>She thought of Him in the calm and quiet atmosphere of Vrndavana, dressed as a cowherd boy.</p>
<p>But at Kuruksetra He was in a royal dress and was accompanied by elephants, horses and crowds of men.</p>
<p>Thus the atmosphere was not congenial for Their meeting.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In his Anubhasya, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura comments: “The gopis are purely engaged in the service of the Lord without motive.</p>
<p>They are not captivated by the opulence of Krsna, nor by the understanding that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Naturally the gopis were inclined to love Krsna, for He was an attractive young boy of Vrndavana village.</p>
<p>Being village girls, they were not very much attracted to the field of Kuruksetra, where Krsna was present with elephants, horses and royal dress.</p>
<p>Indeed, they did not very much appreciate Krsna in that atmosphere.</p>
<p>Krsna was not attracted by the opulence or personal beauty of the gopis but by their pure devotional service.</p>
<p>Similarly, the gopis were attracted to Krsna as a cowherd boy, not in sophisticated guise.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna is inconceivably powerful.</p>
<p>To understand Him, great yogis and saintly persons give up all material engagements and meditate upon Him.</p>
<p>Similarly, those who are overly attracted to material enjoyment, to enhancement of material opulence, to family maintenance or to liberation from the entanglements of this material world take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>But such activities and motivations are unknown to the gopis; they are not at all expert in executing such auspicious activities.</p>
<p>Already transcendentally enlightened, they simply engage their purified senses in the service of the Lord in the remote village of Vrndavana.</p>
<p>The gopis are not interested in dry speculation, in the arts, in music, or other conditions of material life.</p>
<p>They are bereft of all understanding of material enjoyment and renunciation.</p>
<p>Their only desire is to see Krsna return and enjoy spiritual, transcendental pastimes with them.</p>
<p>The gopis want Him simply to stay in Vrndavana so that they can render service unto Him, for His pleasure.</p>
<p>There is not even a tinge of personal sense gratification.</p>

<p>Absorbed in the ecstasy of the gopis, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu wished to see Lord Jagannatha in His original form as Krsna, the son of Nanda Maharaja, standing in Vrndavana and appearing very beautiful, His body curved in three places.</p>
<p>His desire to see that form was always increasing.</p>

<p>radhika-unmada yaiche uddhava-darsane</p>

<p>radhika-unmada—the madness of Srimati Radharani; yaiche—just like; uddhava-darsane—in seeing Uddhava; udghurna-pralapa—talking inconsistently in madness; taiche—similarly; prabhura—of Lord Caitanya; ratri-dine—night and day.</p>
<p>Just as Srimati Radharani talked inconsistently with a bumblebee in the presence of Uddhava, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in His ecstasy talked crazily and inconsistently day and night.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This unmada (madness) is not ordinary madness.</p>
<p>When Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu talked inconsistently, almost like a crazy fellow, He was in the transcendental ecstasy of love.</p>
<p>In the highest transcendental ecstasy there is a feeling of being enchanted in the presence of the enchanter.</p>
<p>When the enchanter and the enchanted become separated, mohana, or bewilderment, occurs.</p>
<p>When so bewildered due to separation, one becomes stunned, and at that time all the bodily symptoms of transcendental ecstasy are manifested.</p>
<p>When they are manifest, one appears inconceivably crazy.</p>
<p>This is called transcendental madness.</p>
<p>In this state, there is imaginative discourse, and one experiences emotions like those of a madman.</p>
<p>The madness of Srimati Radharani was explained to Krsna by Uddhava, who said, “My dear Krsna, because of extreme feelings of separation from You, Srimati Radharani is sometimes making Her bed in the groves of the forest, sometimes rebuking a bluish cloud, and sometimes wandering about in the dense darkness of the forest.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>prathama—first; sutra—synopsis; prabhura—of the Lord; sannyasa-karana—accepting the sannyasa order; sannyasa kari’-after accepting the renounced order; calila—went; prabhu—the Lord; sri-vrndavana—toward Vrndavana.</p>
<p>This is the first synopsis: After accepting the sannyasa order, Caitanya Mahaprabhu proceeded toward Vrndavana.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Clearly these statements are a real account of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s acceptance of the renounced order of life.</p>
<p>His acceptance of this renounced order is not at all comparable to the acceptance of sannyasa by Mayavadis.</p>
<p>After accepting sannyasa, Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted to reach Vrndavana.</p>
<p>He was unlike the Mayavadi sannyasis, who desire to merge into the existence of the Absolute.</p>
<p>For a Vaisnava, acceptance of sannyasa means getting relief from all material activities and completely devoting oneself to the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by Srila Rupa Gosvami (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.255): anasaktasya visayan yatharham upayunjatah nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate.</p>
<p>For a Vaisnava, the renounced order means completely giving up attachment for material things and engaging nonstop in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi sannyasis, however, do not know how to engage everything in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Because they have no devotional training, they think material objects to be untouchable.</p>
<p>Brahma satyam jagan mithya The Mayavadis think that the world is false, but the Vaisnava sannyasis do not think like this.</p>
<p>Vaisnavas say, “Why should the world be false? It is reality, and it is meant for the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” For a Vaisnava sannyasi, renunciation means not accepting anything for personal sense enjoyment.</p>
<p>Devotional service means engaging everything for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>When proceeding toward Vrndavana, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was overwhelmed with ecstatic love for Krsna, and He lost all remembrance of the external world.</p>
<p>In this way He traveled continuously for three days in Radha-desa, the country where the Ganges River does not flow.</p>

<p>First of all, Lord Nityananda bewildered Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu by bringing Him along the banks of the Ganges, saying that it was the river Yamuna.</p>

<p>After three days, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu came to the house of Advaita Acarya at Santipura and accepted alms there.</p>
<p>This was His first acceptance of alms.</p>
<p>At night He performed congregational chanting there.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It appears that in His transcendental ecstasy, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu forgot to eat for three continuous days.</p>
<p>He was then misled by Nityananda Prabhu, who said that the river Ganges was the Yamuna.</p>
<p>Because the Lord was in the ecstasy of going to Vrndavana, He was engladdened to see the Yamuna, although in actuality the river was the Ganges.</p>
<p>In this way the Lord was brought to the house of Advaita Prabhu at Santipura after three days, and He accepted food there.</p>
<p>As long as the Lord remained there, He saw His mother, Sacidevi, and every night executed congregational chanting with all the devotees.</p>

<p>At the house of Advaita Prabhu, He met His mother as well as all the devotees from Mayapura.</p>
<p>He adjusted everything and then went to Jagannatha Puri.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu knew very well that His acceptance of sannyasa was a thunderbolt for His mother.</p>
<p>He therefore called for His mother and the devotees from Mayapura, and by the arrangement of Sri Advaita Acarya, He met them for the last time after His acceptance of sannyasa.</p>
<p>His mother was overwhelmed with grief when she saw that He was clean-shaven.</p>
<p>There was no longer any beautiful hair on His head.</p>
<p>Mother Saci was pacified by all the devotees, and Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu asked her to cook for Him because He was very hungry, not having taken anything for three days.</p>
<p>His mother immediately agreed, and forgetting everything else, she cooked for Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu during all the days she was at the house of Sri Advaita Prabhu.</p>
<p>Then, after a few days, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu requested His mother’s permission to go to Jagannatha Puri.</p>
<p>At His mother’s request, He made Jagannatha Puri His headquarters after His acceptance of sannyasa.</p>
<p>Thus everything was adjusted, and with His mother’s permission Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu proceeded toward Jagannatha Puri.</p>

<p>He visited various temples and heard the story about Madhavendra Puri and the installation of Gopala.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This Madhava Puri is Madhavendra Puri.</p>
<p>Another Madhava Puri is Madhavacarya, who was the spiritual master of a devotee in the line of Gadadhara Pandita and who wrote a book known as Sri Mangala-bhasya.</p>

<p>Syamasundara Adhikari was a descendant of Rasikananda Murari, the chief disciple of Syamananda Gosvami.</p>
<p>A few miles before the Jagannatha Puri station is a small station called Saksi-gopala.</p>
<p>Near this station is a village named Satyavadi, where the temple of Saksi-gopala is situated.</p>

<p>Alalanatha is also known as Brahmagiri.</p>
<p>This place is about fourteen miles from Jagannatha Puri and is also on the beach.</p>
<p>There is a temple of Jagannatha there.</p>
<p>At the present moment a police station and post office are situated there because so many people come to see the temple.</p>
<p>The word anavasara is used when Sri Jagannathaji cannot be seen in the temple.</p>
<p>After the bathing ceremony (snana-yatra), Lord Jagannatha apparently becomes sick.</p>
<p>He is therefore removed to His private apartment, where no one can see Him.</p>
<p>Actually, during this period renovations are made on the body of the Jagannatha Deity.</p>
<p>This is called nava-yauvana.</p>
<p>During the Ratha-yatra ceremony, Lord Jagannatha once again comes before the public.</p>
<p>Thus for fifteen days after the bathing ceremony, Lord Jagannatha is not visible to any visitors.</p>

<p>With great assurance he then told the devotees that Lord Caitanya would not go to Vrndavana at that time.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Nrsimhananda Brahmacari was a great devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu; therefore when he heard that from Kuliya Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was going to Vrndavana, although he had no material wealth he began to construct within his mind a very attractive path or road for Caitanya Mahaprabhu to traverse.</p>
<p>Some of the description of this path is given above.</p>
<p>But even mentally he could not construct the road beyond Kanai Natasala.</p>
<p>Therefore he concluded that Caitanya Mahaprabhu would not go to Vrndavana at that time.</p>
<p>For a pure devotee, it is the same whether he materially constructs a path or constructs one within his mind.</p>
<p>This is because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Janardana, is bhava-grahi, or appreciative of the sentiment.</p>
<p>For Him a path made with actual jewels and a path made of mental jewels are the same.</p>
<p>Though subtle, mind is also matter, so any path-indeed, anything for the service of the Lord, whether in gross matter or in subtle matter-is accepted equally by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord accepts the attitude of His devotee and sees how much he is prepared to serve Him.</p>
<p>The devotee is at liberty to serve the Lord either in gross matter or in subtle matter.</p>
<p>The important point is that the service be in relation with the Supreme Personality of Godheand.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (9.26):</p>
<p>patram puspam phalam toyam</p>
<p>yo me bhaktya prayacchati</p>
<p>tad aham bhakty-upahrtam</p>
<p>asnami prayatatmanah “If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it.” The real ingredient is bhakti (devotion).</p>
<p>Pure devotion is uncontaminated by the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Ahaituky apratihata: unconditional devotional service cannot be checked by any material condition.</p>
<p>This means that one does not have to be very rich to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Even the poorest man can equally serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he has pure devotion.</p>
<p>If there is no ulterior motive, devotional service cannot be checked by any material condition.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A monarch is certainly a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, sarva-loka-mahesvaram: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the proprietor of all planetary systems.</p>
<p>In each and every planet there must be some king, governmental head or executive.</p>
<p>Such a person is supposed to be the representative of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he must see to the interests of all the people.</p>
<p>Therefore Lord Visnu, as Paramatma, gives the king all intelligence to execute governmental affairs.</p>
<p>Srila Rupa Gosvami therefore asked the King what was in his mind concerning Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and indicated that whatever the King thought about Him was correct.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although the two brothers, Rupa and Sanatana (at that time Dabira Khasa and Sakara Mallika), presented themselves as being born in a low family, they nonetheless belonged to a most respectable brahmana family that was originally from Karnata.</p>
<p>Thus they actually belonged to the brahmana caste.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of being associated with the Muslim governmental service, their customs and behavior resembled those of the Muslims.</p>
<p>Therefore they presented themselves as nica-jati.</p>
<p>The word jati means birth.</p>
<p>According to sastra, there are three kinds of birth.</p>
<p>The first birth is from the womb of the mother, the second birth is the acceptance of the reformatory method, and the third birth is acceptance by the spiritual master (initiation).</p>
<p>One becomes abominable by adopting an abominable profession or by associating with people who are naturally abominable.</p>
<p>Rupa and Sanatana, as Dabira Khasa and Sakara Mallika, associated with Muslims, who were naturally opposed to brahminical culture and cow protection.</p>
<p>In Srimad-Bhagavatam (Seventh Canto) it is stated that every person belongs to a certain classification.</p>
<p>A person is identifiable by the special symptoms mentioned in the sastras.</p>
<p>By one’s symptoms, one is known to belong to a certain caste.</p>
<p>Both Dabira Khasa and Sakara Mallika belonged to the brahmana caste, but because they were employed by Muslims, their original habits degenerated into those of the Muslim community.</p>
<p>Since the symptoms of brahminical culture were almost nil, they identified themselves with the lowest caste.</p>
<p>In the Bhakti-ratnakara it is clearly stated that because Sakara Mallika and Dabira Khasa associated with lower-class men, they introduced themselves as belonging to the lower classes.</p>
<p>Actually, however, they had been born in respectable brahmana families.</p>

<p>However, volumes of sinful activity can be burned to ashes simply by a dim reflection of the chanting of Your holy name.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Rupa Gosvami and Sanatana Gosvami presented themselves as being lower than the two brothers Jagai and Madhai, who were delivered by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>When Rupa and Sanatana compared themselves to Jagai and Madhai, they found themselves inferior because the Lord had no trouble in delivering two drunken brothers.</p>
<p>This was so because, despite the fact that they were addicted to sinful activity, in other ways their life was brilliant.</p>
<p>They belonged to the brahmana caste of Navadvipa, and such brahmanas were pious by nature.</p>
<p>Although they had been addicted to some sinful activities due to bad association, those unwanted things could vanish simply because of the chanting of the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Another point for Jagai and Madhai was that, as members of a brahmana family, they did not accept service under anyone.</p>
<p>The sastras strictly forbid a brahmana to accept service under anyone.</p>
<p>The idea is that by accepting a master, one accepts the occupation of a dog.</p>
<p>In other words, a dog cannot thrive without having a master, and for the sake of pleasing the master, dogs offend many people.</p>
<p>They bark at innocent people just to please the master.</p>
<p>Similarly, when one is a servant, he has to perform abominable activities according to the orders of the master.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Dabira Khasa and Sakara Mallika compared their position to that of Jagai and Madhai, they found Jagai and Madhai’s position far better.</p>
<p>Jagai and Madhai never accepted the service of a low-class person; nor were they forced to execute abominable activities under the order of a low-class master.</p>
<p>Jagai and Madhai chanted the name of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu by way of blasphemy, but because they simply chanted His name, they immediately became free from the reactions of sinful activities.</p>
<p>Thus later they were saved.</p>

<p>mleccha-jati—belonging to the meat-eater caste; mleccha-sevi—servants of the meat-eaters; kari—we execute; mleccha-karma—the work of meat-eaters; go—cows; brahmana—brahmanas; drohi—those inimical to; sange—with; amara—our; sangama—association “Actually we belong to the caste of meat-eaters because we are servants of meat-eaters.</p>
<p>Indeed, our activities are exactly like those of the meat-eaters.</p>
<p>Because we always associate with such people, we are inimical toward the cows and brahmanas.”</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are two kinds of meat-eaters-one who is born in a family of meat-eaters and one who has learned to associate with meat-eaters.</p>
<p>From Srila Rupa and Sanatana Gosvamis (formerly Dabira Khasa and Sakara Mallika) we can learn how one attains the character of a meat-eater simply by associating with meat-eaters.</p>
<p>At the present moment in India the presidential offices are occupied by many so-called brahmanas, but the state maintains slaughterhouses for killing cows and makes propaganda against Vedic civilization.</p>
<p>The first principle of Vedic civilization is the avoidance of meat-eating and intoxication.</p>
<p>Presently in India, intoxication and meat-eating are encouraged, and the so-called learned brahmanas presiding over this state of affairs have certainly become degraded according to the standard given herein by Srila Rupa Gosvami and Sanatana Gosvami.</p>
<p>These so-called brahmanas give sanction to slaughterhouses for the sake of a fat salary, and they do not protest these abominable activities.</p>
<p>By deprecating the principles of Vedic civilization and supporting cow-killing, they are immediately degraded to the platform of mlecchas and yavanas.</p>
<p>A mleccha is a meat-eater, and a yavana is one who has deviated from Vedic culture.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, such mlecchas and yavanas are in executive power.</p>
<p>How, then, can there be peace and prosperity in the state? The king or the president must be the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>When Maharaja Yudhisthira accepted the rule of Bharata-varsa (formerly this entire planet, including all the seas and land), he took sanction from authorities like Bhismadeva and Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>He thus ruled the entire world according to religious principles.</p>
<p>At the present moment, however, heads of state do not care for religious principles.</p>
<p>If irreligious people vote on an issue, even though it be against the principles of the sastras, the bills will be passed.</p>
<p>The president and heads of state become sinful by agreeing to such abominable activities.</p>
<p>Sanatana and Rupa Gosvamis pleaded guilty to such activities; they therefore classified themselves among the mlecchas, although born in a brahmana family.</p>

<p>mora karma, mora hate-galaya bandhiya</p>
<p>ku-visaya-vistha-garte diyache phelaiya</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>mora—our; karma—activities; mora—our; hate—on the hand; galaya—on the neck; bandhiya—binding; ku-visaya—of abominable objects of sense gratification; vistha—of the stool; garte—in the ditch; diyache phelaiya—have been thrown.</p>
<p>The two brothers, Sakara Mallika and Dabira Khasa, very humbly submitted that due to their abominable activities they were now bound by the neck and hands and had been thrown into a ditch filled with abominable stoollike objects of material sense enjoyment.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has explained ku-visaya garta as follows: “Because of the activities of the senses, we become subjected to many sense gratificatory processes and are thus entangled by the laws of material nature.</p>
<p>This entanglement is called visaya.</p>
<p>When the sense gratificatory processes are executed by pious activity, they are called su-visaya.</p>
<p>The word su means ’good,’ and visaya means ’sense objects.’ When the sense gratificatory activities are performed under sinful conditions, they are called ku-visaya, bad sense enjoyment.</p>
<p>In either case, either ku-visaya or su-visaya, these are material activities.</p>
<p>As such, they are compared to stool.</p>
<p>In other words, such things are to be avoided.</p>
<p>To become free from su-visaya and ku-visaya, one must engage himself in the transcendental loving service of Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The activities of devotional service are free from the contamination of material qualities.</p>
<p>Therefore, to be free from the reactions of su-visaya and ku-visaya, one must take to Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>In that way, one will save himself from contamination.” In this connection, Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung:</p>
<p>karma-kanda, jnana-kanda, kevala visera bhanda</p>
<p>amrta baliya yeba khaya</p>
<p>nana yoni sada phire, kadarya bhaksana kare</p>
<p>tara janma adhah-pate yaya</p>
<p>Su-visaya and ku-visaya both fall under the category of karma-kanda.</p>
<p>There is another kanda (platform of activity), called jnana-kanda, or philosophical speculation about the effects of ku-visaya and su-visaya with the intention to find out the means of deliverance from material entanglement.</p>
<p>On the platform of jnana-kanda, one may give up the objects of ku-visaya and su-visaya.</p>
<p>But that is not the perfection of life.</p>
<p>Perfection is transcendental to both jnana-kanda and karma-kanda; it is on the platform of devotional service.</p>
<p>If we do not take to devotional service in Krsna consciousness, we have to remain within this material world and endure the repetition of birth and death due to the effects of jnana-kanda and karma-kanda.</p>
<p>Therefore Narottama dasa Thakura says:</p>
<p>nana yoni sada phire, kadarya bhaksana kare</p>
<p>tara janma adhah-pate yaya “One travels throughout various species of life and eats all kinds of nonsense.</p>
<p>Thus he spoils his existence.” A man in material existence and attached to ku-visaya or su-visaya is in the same position as that of a worm in stool.</p>
<p>After all, whether it be moist or dry, stool is stool.</p>
<p>Similarly, material activities may be either pious or impious, but because they are all material, they are compared to stool.</p>
<p>Worms cannot get out of stool by their own endeavor; similarly, those who are overly attached to material existence cannot get out of materialism and suddenly become Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>Attachment is there.</p>
<p>As explained by Prahlada Maharaja in Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.30):</p>
<p>matir na krsne paratah svato va</p>
<p>mitho ’bhipadyeta grha-vratanam</p>
<p>adanta-gobhir visatam tamisram</p>
<p>punah-punas-carvita-carvananam “Those who have made up their minds to remain in this material world and enjoy sense gratification cannot become Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>Because of their attachment to material activity, they cannot attain liberation, either by the instructions of superior persons or by their own endeavor or by passing resolutions in big conferences.</p>
<p>Because their senses are uncontrolled, they gradually descend to the darkest regions of material existence to repeat the same process of birth and death in desirable or undesirable species of life.”</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In His teachings to Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has declared every living entity to be an eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is the constitutional position of all living entities.</p>
<p>Just as a dog or servant is very satisfied to get a competent, perfect master, or as a child is completely satisfied to possess a competent father, so the living entity is satisfied by completely engaging in the service of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He thereby knows that he has a competent master to save him from all kinds of danger.</p>
<p>Unless the living entity comes to the guaranteed protection of the Supreme Lord, He is full of anxiety.</p>
<p>This life of anxiety is called material existence.</p>
<p>To be completely satisfied and devoid of anxiety, one must come to the position of eternally rendering service to the Supreme Lord.</p>

<p>These are spiritual marks, symptoms of a perfect Vaisnava.” This is a verse from the Padma Purana, Uttara-khanda.</p>
<p>A member of the sahajiya-sampradaya does not change his name; therefore he cannot be accepted as a Gaudiya Vaisnava.</p>
<p>If a person does not change his name after initiation, it is to be understood that he will continue in his bodily conception of life.</p>

<p>When all of the devotees saw the mercy of the Lord upon the two brothers, they were very much gladdened, and they began to chant the holy name of the Lord, “Hari! Hari!”</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Narottama dasa Thakura says, chadiya vaisnava seva nistara payeche keba: unless one serves a Vaisnava, he cannot be delivered.</p>
<p>The spiritual master initiates the disciple to deliver him, and if the disciple executes the order of the spiritual master and does not offend other Vaisnavas, his path is clear.</p>
<p>Consequently Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu requested all the Vaisnavas present to show mercy toward the two brothers, Rupa and Sanatana, who had just been initiated by the Lord.</p>
<p>When a Vaisnava sees that another Vaisnava is a recipient of the Lord’s mercy, he becomes very happy.</p>
<p>Vaisnavas are not envious.</p>
<p>If a Vaisnava, by the mercy of the Lord, is empowered by Him to distribute the Lord’s holy name all over the world, other Vaisnavas become very joyful-that is, if they are truly Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>One who is envious of the success of a Vaisnava is certainly not a Vaisnava himself, but an ordinary mundane man.</p>
<p>Envy and jealousy are manifested by mundane people, not by Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>Why should a Vaisnava be envious of another Vaisnava who is successful in spreading the holy name of the Lord? An actual Vaisnava is very pleased to accept another Vaisnava who is bestowing the Lord’s mercy.</p>
<p>A mundane person in the dress of a Vaisnava should not be respected but rejected.</p>
<p>This is enjoined in the sastra (upeksa).</p>
<p>The word upeksa means neglect.</p>
<p>One should neglect an envious person.</p>
<p>A preacher’s duty is to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead, make friendships with Vaisnavas, show mercy to the innocent and reject or neglect those who are envious or jealous.</p>
<p>There are many jealous people in the dress of Vaisnavas in this Krsna consciousness movement, and they should be completely neglected.</p>
<p>There is no need to serve a jealous person who is in the dress of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>When Narottama dasa Thakura says chadiya vaisnava seva nistara payeche keba, he is indicating an actual Vaisnava, not an envious or jealous person in the dress of a Vaisnava.</p>

<p>In accordance with the instructions of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the two brothers, Rupa and Sanatana, immediately touched the lotus feet of these Vaisnavas, who all became very happy and congratulated the two brothers for having received the mercy of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This behavior is indicative of real Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>When they saw that Rupa and Sanatana were fortunate enough to receive the mercy of the Lord, they were so pleased that they all congratulated the two brothers.</p>
<p>A jealous person in the dress of a Vaisnava is not at all happy to see the success of another Vaisnava in receiving the Lord’s mercy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in this Age of Kali there are many mundane persons in the dress of Vaisnavas, and Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has described them as disciples of Kali.</p>
<p>He says, kali-cela.</p>
<p>He indicates that there is another Vaisnava, a pseudoVaisnava with tilaka on his nose and kanthi beads around his neck.</p>
<p>Such a pseudoVaisnava associates with money and women and is jealous of successful Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>Although passing for a Vaisnava, his only business is earning money in the dress of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Bhaktivinoda Thakura therefore says that such a pseudoVaisnava is not a Vaisnava at all but a disciple of Kali-yuga.</p>
<p>A disciple of Kali cannot become an acarya by the decision of some high court.</p>
<p>Mundane votes have no jurisdiction to elect a Vaisnava acarya.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava acarya is self-effulgent, and there is no need for any court judgment.</p>
<p>A false acarya may try to override a Vaisnava by a high-court decision, but Bhaktivinoda Thakura says that he is nothing but a disciple of Kali-yuga.</p>

<p>Sometimes, for business purposes, large crowds of men are taken to different places of pilgrimage, and money is collected from them.</p>
<p>That is a very lucrative business, but Rupa and Sanatana Gosvamis, expressing their opinion in the presence of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, disapproved of such crowded pilgrimages.</p>

<p>This Vallabha Bhatta is the head of the Vaisnava sampradaya known as the Vallabhacarya-sampradaya in western India.</p>
<p>There is a long story about Vallabha Acarya narrated in the Caitanya-caritamrta, specifically in the Seventh Chapter of Antya-lila and the Nineteenth Chapter of Madhya-lila.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu visited the house of Vallabha Acarya on the other side of Prayaga, in a place known as Adaila-grama.</p>
<p>Later, Vallabha Bhatta saw Caitanya Mahaprabhu at Jagannatha Puri to explain his commentary on Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>He was very proud of his writings, but Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu corrected him, telling him that a Vaisnava should be humble and follow in the footsteps of his predecessors.</p>
<p>The Lord told him that his pride in being superior to Sridhara Svami was not at all befitting a Vaisnava.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after the disappearance of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, many apa-sampradayas (so-called followers) invented many ways not approved by the acaryas.</p>
<p>Bhaktivinoda Thakura has described them as the aula, baula, kartabhaja, neda, daravesa, sani sahajiya, sakhibheki, smarta, jata-gosani, ativadi, cudadhari and gauranga-nagari.</p>
<p>The aula-sampradaya, baula-sampradaya and others invented their own ways of understanding Lord Caitanya’s philosophy, without following in the footsteps of the acaryas.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself indicates herein that all such attempts would simply spoil the spirit of His cult.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami writes in Vilapa-kusumanjali (5):</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Thus Srila Kaviraja Gosvami, strictly following in the footsteps of Sri Vyasadeva, gives a synopsis of the lilas of Caitanya-caritamrta.</p>
<p>He has given such a description at the end of each canto.</p>
<p>In the Adi-lila he outlined the pastimes of the Lord in the five stages of boyhood, leaving the details of the description to Srila Vrndavana dasa Thakura.</p>
<p>Now in this chapter the pastimes that took place at the end of the Lord’s life are summarized.</p>
<p>These are described in the Madhya-lila and Antya-lila.</p>
<p>The rest of the pastimes have been described in a synopsis in the Second Chapter of the Madhya-lila.</p>
<p>In this way the author has gradually described both the madhya-lila and the antya-lila.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#1287" id="1287">1.287</a></h3>

<p>Praying at the lotus feet of Sri Rupa and Sri Raghunatha, always desiring their mercy, I, Krsnadasa, narrate Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, following in their footsteps.</p>
<p>Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya-lila, First Chapter, summarizing the later pastimes of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>The Ecstatic Manifestations of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu In the Second Chapter of the Madhya-lila, the author describes the pastimes the Lord performed during the last twelve years of His life.</p>
<p>Thus he has also described some of the pastimes of the Antya-lila.</p>
<p>Why he has done so is very difficult for an ordinary person to understand.</p>
<p>The author expects that reading the pastimes of the Lord will gradually help a person awaken his dormant love of Krsna.</p>
<p>Actually this Caitanya-caritamrta was compiled by the author during very old age.</p>
<p>Fearing he might not be able to finish the book, he has included a synopsis of the antya-lila here in the Second Chapter.</p>
<p>Srila Kaviraja Gosvami has confirmed that the opinion of Svarupa Damodara is authoritative in the matter of devotional service.</p>
<p>Over and above this are the notes of Svarupa Damodara, memorized by Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, who also helped in the compilation of Caitanya-caritamrta.</p>
<p>After the disappearance of Svarupa Damodara Gosvami, Raghunatha dasa Gosvami went to Vrndavana.</p>
<p>At that time the author, Srila Kaviraja Gosvami, met Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, by whose mercy he also could memorize all the notes.</p>
<p>In this way the author was able to complete this transcendental literature, Sri Caitanya-caritamrta.</p>
