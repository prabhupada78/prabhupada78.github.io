<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kukkura rahila—the dog remained; sivananda duhkhi haila—Sivananda became very unhappy; dasa pana—ten pana; kadi—small conchshells; diya—paying; kukkure—the dog; para kaila—crossed to the other side of the river.</p>
<p>Sivananda Sena, unhappy that the dog had to stay behind, paid the boatman ten pana of conchshells to take the dog across the river.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One pana is eighty kadis, or small conchshells.</p>
<p>Formerly, even fifty or sixty years ago, there was no paper currency in India.</p>
<p>Coins were generally made not of base metal but of gold, silver and copper.</p>
<p>In other words, the medium of exchange was really something valuable.</p>
<p>Four pieces of kadi made one ganda, and twenty such gandas equaled one pana.</p>
<p>This kadi was also used as a medium of exchange; therefore Sivananda Sena paid for the dog with dasa pana, or eighty times ten pieces of kadi.</p>
<p>In those days one paisa was also subdivided into small conchshells, but at the present moment the prices for commodities have gone so high that there is nothing one can get in exchange for only one paisa.</p>
<p>With one paisa in those days, however, one could purchase sufficient vegetables to provide for a whole family.</p>
<p>Even thirty years ago, vegetables were occasionally so inexpensive that one paisa’s worth could provide for a whole family for a day.</p>

<p>In the morning they looked for the dog, but it could not be found anywhere.</p>
<p>All the Vaisnavas were astonished.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sivananda Sena’s attachment to the dog was a great boon for that animal.</p>
<p>The dog appears to have been a street dog.</p>
<p>Since it naturally began to follow Sivananda Sena while he was going to Jagannatha Puri with his party, he accepted it into his party and maintained it the same way he was maintaining the other devotees.</p>
<p>It appears that although on one occasion the dog was not allowed aboard a boat, Sivananda did not leave the dog behind but paid more money just to induce the boatman to take the dog across the river.</p>
<p>Then when the servant forgot to feed the dog and the dog disappeared, Sivananda, being very anxious, sent ten men to find it.</p>
<p>When they could not find it, Sivananda observed a fast.</p>
<p>Thus it appears that somehow or other Sivananda had become attached to the dog.</p>
<p>As will be evident from the following verses, the dog got the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and was immediately promoted to Vaikuntha to become an eternal devotee.</p>
<p>Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has therefore sung, tumi ta’ thakura, tomara kukkura, baliya janaha more (Saranagati 19).</p>
<p>He thus offers to become the dog of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>There are many other instances in which the pet animal of a Vaisnava was delivered back home to Vaikunthaloka, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Such is the benefit of somehow or other becoming the favorite of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has also sung, kita-janma ha-u yatha tuya dasa (Saranagati 11).</p>
<p>There is no harm in taking birth again and again.</p>
<p>Our only desire should be to take birth under the care of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Fortunately we had the opportunity to be born of a Vaisnava father who took care of us very nicely.</p>
<p>He prayed to Srimati Radharani that in the future we would become a servant of the eternal consort of Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus somehow or other we are now engaged in that service.</p>
<p>We may conclude that even as dogs we must take shelter of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>The benefit will be the same as that which accrues to an advanced devotee under a Vaisnava’s care.</p>

<p>The River Ganges flowing from the heavenly planets is full of golden lotus flowers, and we, the residents of those planets, eat the stems of the flowers.</p>
<p>Thus we are very beautiful, more so than the inhabitants of any other planet.</p>
<p>This is due to the law of cause and effect, for if one eats food in the mode of goodness, the mode of goodness increases the beauty of his body.’ &quot;</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One’s bodily luster and beauty, one’s constitution, one’s activities and one’s qualities all depend on the law of cause and effect.</p>
<p>There are three qualities in material nature, and as stated in the Bhagavad-gita (13.22), karanam guna-sango ’sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu: one takes birth in a good or bad family according to his previous association with the qualities of material nature.</p>
<p>Therefore one seriously eager to achieve transcendental perfection, Krsna consciousness, must eat Krsna prasada.</p>
<p>Such food is sattvika, or in the material quality of goodness, but when offered to Krsna it becomes transcendental.</p>
<p>Our Krsna consciousness movement distributes Krsna prasada, and those who eat such transcendental food are sure to become devotees of the Lord.</p>
<p>This is a very scientific method, as stated in this verse from Nala-naisadha (3.17): karyam nidanad dhi gunan adhite.</p>
<p>If in all one’s activities he strictly adheres to the mode of goodness, he will certainly develop his dormant Krsna consciousness and ultimately become a pure devotee of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>Unfortunately at the present moment the bodily constitutions of the leaders of society, especially the governmental leaders, are polluted.</p>
<p>As described in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.1.40):</p>
<p>asamskrtah kriya-hina</p>
<p>rajasa tamasavrtah</p>
<p>prajas te bhaksayisyanti</p>
<p>mleccha rajanya-rupinah Such leaders have no chance to purify their eating.</p>
<p>Politicians meet together and exchange good wishes by drinking liquor, which is so polluted and sinful that naturally drunkards and meat-eaters develop a degraded mentality in the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>The processes of eating in different modes are explained in the Bhagavad-gita, wherein it is stated that those who eat rice, wheat, vegetables, milk products, fruit and sugar are situated in the elevated quality of goodness.</p>
<p>Therefore if we want a happy and tranquil political situation, we must select leaders who eat Krsna prasada.</p>
<p>Otherwise the leaders will eat meat and drink wine, and thus they will be asamskrtah, unreformed, and kriya-hinah, devoid of spiritual behavior.</p>
<p>In other words, they will be mlecchas and yavanas, or men who are unclean in their habits.</p>
<p>Through taxation, such men exploit the citizens as much as possible, and in this way they devour the citizens of the state instead of benefiting them.</p>
<p>We therefore cannot expect a government to be efficient if it is headed by such unclean mlecchas and yavanas.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said in the Padma Purana, atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih.</p>
<p>Chanting and hearing of the transcendental holy name of the Lord cannot be performed by the ordinary senses.</p>
<p>The transcendental vibration of the Lord’s holy name is completely spiritual.</p>
<p>Thus it must be received from spiritual sources and must be chanted after having been heard from a spiritual master.</p>
<p>One who hears the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra must receive it from the spiritual master by aural reception.</p>
<p>Srila Sanatana Gosvami has forbidden us to hear the holy name of Krsna chanted by non-Vaisnavas, such as professional actors and singers, for it will have no effect.</p>
<p>It is like milk touched by the lips of a serpent, as stated in the padma purana:</p>
<p>avaisnava-mukhodgirnam</p>
<p>putam hari-kathamrtam</p>
<p>sravanam naiva kartavyam</p>
<p>sarpocchistam yatha payah As far as possible, therefore, the devotees in the Krsna consciousness movement gather to chant the holy name of Krsna in public so that both the chanters and the listeners may benefit.</p>

<p>dadati sva-padantikam “When will Srila Rupa Gosvami Prabhupada, who has established within this material world the mission to fulfill the desire of Lord Caitanya, give me shelter under his lotus feet?” The special function of Srila Rupa Gosvami is to establish the feelings of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>These feelings are His desires that His special mercy be spread throughout the world in this Kali-yuga prthivite ache yata nagaradi-grama</p>
<p>sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama His desire is that all over the world everyone, in every village and every town, know of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His sankirtana movement.</p>

<p>Now again, by the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the same feelings are being spread all over the world by the servants of the Gosvamis, and devotees who are pure and simple will appreciate this attempt.</p>

<p>Yet this does not matter to the preachers of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s cult, for all over the world they will continue to perform this responsible work, even though persons who are like cats and dogs do not appreciate them.</p>

<p>Ramananda Raya inquired, “How have you introduced the assembly of the players?” Rupa Gosvami replied, &quot;The players assemble at a suitable time under the heading of pravartaka.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In a drama all the actors are called patra, or players.</p>
<p>This is stated by Visvanatha Kaviraja in the Sahitya-darpana (6.283):</p>
<p>divya-martye sa tad-rupo</p>
<p>misram anyataras tayoh</p>
<p>sucayed vastu-bijam va-</p>
<p>mukham patram athapi va The meaning of amukha is stated by Srila Rupa Gosvami in the Nataka-candrika:</p>
<p>sutra-dharo nati brute</p>
<p>sva-karyam pratiyuktitah</p>
<p>prastutaksepicitroktya</p>
<p>yat tad amukham iritam When Srila Ramananda Raya inquired about the arrangement for introducing the assembly of players in the drama, Rupa Gosvami replied that when the players first enter the stage in response to the time, the introduction is technically called pravartaka.</p>
<p>For an example one may consult the Antya-lila, First Chapter, verse 17.</p>
<p>Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura says that the introduction, which is technically called amukha, may be of five different kinds, according to the Sahitya-darpana (6.288):</p>
<p>udghatyakah kathodghatah</p>
<p>prayogatisayas tatha</p>
<p>pravartakavalagite</p>
<p>panca prastavana-bhidah Introductions may be classified as follows: (1) udghatyaka, (2) kathodghata, (3) prayogatisaya, (4) pravartaka and (5) avalagita.</p>
<p>These five kinds of introduction are called amukha.</p>
<p>Thus Srila Ramananda Raya asked which of the five introductions had been employed, and Srila Rupa Gosvami replied that he had used the introduction called the pravartaka.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The method of inducing the audience to become more and more eager to hear by praising the time and place, the hero and the audience is called prarocana.</p>
<p>This is the statement regarding prarocana in the Nataka-candrika:</p>
<p>desa-kala-katha-vastu-</p>
<p>sabhyadinam prasamsaya</p>
<p>srotrnam unmukhi-karah</p>
<p>kathiteyam prarocana Similarly the Sahitya-darpana (6.286) says:</p>
<p>tasyah prarocana vithi</p>
<p>tatha prahasana-mukhe</p>
<p>anganyatronmukhi-karah</p>
<p>prasamsatah prarocana Any literature presented in Sanskrit must follow the rules and regulations mentioned in the authoritative reference books.</p>
<p>The technical inquiries by Srila Ramananda Raya and the replies of Srila Rupa Gosvami indicate that both of them were expert and fully conversant with the techniques of writing drama.</p>

<p>You are so expert in dramatic expression that each of my statements before you is like a wave from an ocean of impudence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this connection Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura again quotes the following verse from the Sahitya-darpana (6.288):</p>
<p>udghatyakah kathodghatah</p>
<p>prayogatisayas tatha</p>
<p>pravartakavalagite</p>
<p>panca prastavana-bhidah Thus the technical names for the five kinds of introductory scenes of the drama are listed as udghatyaka, kathodghata, prayogatisaya, pravartaka and avalagita.</p>
<p>When Srila Ramananda Raya inquired which of these five Srila Rupa Gosvami had used to accomplish the technical introduction to his drama Lalita-madhava, Rupa Gosvami replied that he had used the introduction technically called udghatyaka.</p>
<p>According to Bharati-vrtti, three technical terms used are prarocana, vithi and prahasana.</p>
<p>Thus Rupa Gosvami also mentioned vithi, which is a technical term for a certain type of expression.</p>
<p>According to the Sahitya-darpana (6.520):</p>
<p>vithyam eko bhaved ankah</p>
<p>kascid eko ’tra kalpyate</p>
<p>akasa-bhasitair uktais</p>
<p>citram pratyuktim asritah The vithi beginning of a drama consists of only one scene.</p>
<p>In that scene, one of the heroes enters the stage, and by means of opposing statements uttered by a voice from the sky (offstage), he introduces the abundant conjugal mellow and other mellows to some degree.</p>
<p>In the course of the introduction, all the seeds of the play are planted.</p>
<p>This introduction is called udghatyaka because the player dances on the stage.</p>
<p>This term also indicates that the full moon enters the stage.</p>
<p>In this case, when the word natata (“dancing on the stage”) is linked with the moon, its meaning is obscure, but because the meaning becomes very clear when the word natata is linked with Krsna, this type of introduction is called udghatyaka.</p>
<p>Srila Ramananda Raya used highly technical terms when he discussed this with Srila Rupa Gosvami.</p>
<p>Rupa Gosvami admitted that Srila Ramananda Raya was a greatly learned scholar of bona fide dramatic composition.</p>
<p>Thus although Srila Rupa Gosvami was quite fit to answer Srila Ramananda Raya’s questions, due to his Vaisnava humility he admitted that his words were impudent.</p>
<p>Actually both Rupa Gosvami and Ramananda Raya were scholarly experts in composing poetry and presenting it strictly according to the Sahitya-darpana and other Vedic literatures.</p>

<p>harim uddisate rajo-bharah</p>
<p>puratah sangamayaty amum tamah</p>
<p>vrajavama-drsam na paddhatih</p>
<p>prakata sarva-drsah sruter api</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>harim—Krsna; uddisate—it indicates; rajah-bharah—dust from the cows,; puratah—in front; sangamayati—causes to meet; amum—Krsna; tamah—the darkness; vrajavama-drsam—of the damsels of Vrndavana; na—not; paddhatih—the course of activities; prakata—manifested; sarva-drsah—who know everything; sruteh—of the Vedas; api—as well as.</p>
<p>The dust from cows and calves on the road creates a kind of darkness indicating that Krsna is returning home from the pasture.</p>
<p>Also, the darkness of evening provokes the gopis to meet Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus the pastimes of Krsna and the gopis are covered by a kind of transcendental darkness and are therefore impossible for ordinary scholars of the Vedas to see.’</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse from the Lalita-madhava (1.23) is spoken by Paurnamasi in a conversation with Gargi.</p>
<p>Krsna stated in the Bhagavad-gita, traigunya-visaya veda nistraigunyo bhavarjuna.</p>
<p>Thus He advised Arjuna to rise above the modes of material nature, for the entire Vedic system is filled with descriptions involving sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna.</p>
<p>People are generally covered by the quality of rajo-guna and are therefore unable to understand the pastimes of Krsna with the gopis of Vraja.</p>
<p>Moreover, the quality of tamo-guna further disturbs their understanding.</p>
<p>In Vrndavana, however, although Krsna is covered by the hazy darkness of the dust, the gopis can nevertheless understand that within the dust storm is Krsna.</p>
<p>Because they are His topmost devotees, they can perceive His hand in everything.</p>
<p>Thus even in the dark or in a hazy storm of dust, devotees can understand what Krsna is doing.</p>
<p>The purport of this verse is that Krsna is never lost, under any circumstances, to the vision of exalted devotees like the gopis.</p>

<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu replied, “I met Srila Rupa Gosvami at Prayaga.</p>
<p>He attracted and satisfied Me because of his qualities.”</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme personality of Godhead is not partial to some and neutral to others.</p>
<p>One can actually draw the attention of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by service.</p>
<p>Then one is further empowered by the Lord to act in such a way that everyone can appreciate his service.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (4.11): ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham.</p>
<p>Krsna is responsive.</p>
<p>If one tries to render his best service to the Lord, the Lord gives him the power to do so.</p>
<p>Krsna also says in the Bhagavad-gita (10.10):</p>
<p>tesam satata-yuktanam</p>
<p>bhajatam priti-purvakam</p>
<p>dadami buddhi-yogam tam</p>
<p>yena mam upayanti te “To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.” Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu bestowed His special favor upon Srila Rupa Gosvami because Rupa Gosvami wanted to serve the Lord to the best of his ability.</p>
<p>Such is the reciprocation between the devotee and the Lord in the discharge of devotional duties.</p>

<p>I empowered both of these brothers to go to Vrndavana to expand the literature of bhakti.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu informed Srila Ramananda Raya that he and Sanatana Gosvami had engaged equally in devotional service after giving up all relationships with material activity.</p>
<p>Such renunciation is a symptom of an unalloyed devotee engaged in the service of the Lord with no tinge of material contamination.</p>
<p>According to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, this is the position of trnad api sunicena taror api sahisnuna.</p>
<p>A pure devotee, free from the reactions of the material modes of nature, executes devotional service with tolerance like that of a tree.</p>
<p>He also feels humbler than the grass.</p>
<p>Such a devotee, who is called niskincana or free from all material possessions, is always absorbed in emotional love of Godhead.</p>
<p>He is reluctant to perform any kind of sense gratification.</p>
<p>In other words, such a devotee is free from all material bondage, but he engages in Krsna conscious activities.</p>
<p>Such expert devotional service is performed without hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Humility, renunciation and learned scholarship were combined in Sanatana Gosvami, the ideal pure devotee, who was on the same level of understanding as Srila Ramananda Raya.</p>
<p>Like Ramananda Raya, Sanatana Gosvami was a fully cognizant expert in the conclusions of devotional service and was therefore able to describe such transcendental knowledge.</p>

<p>Anyone empowered to do this can bring the entire world under Your influence.”</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This passage parallels the statement krsna-sakti vina nahe tara pravartana, which means that unless empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, one cannot spread the holy name of the Lord throughout the entire world (Cc.Antya 7.11).</p>
<p>Under the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a pure devotee can preach the holy name of the Lord so that everyone may take advantage of this facility and thus become Krsna conscious.</p>

<p>Sri Rupa Gosvami said, &quot;I do not know anything.</p>
<p>The only transcendental words I can utter are those which Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu makes me speak.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The poet or writer dealing with transcendental subject matters is not an ordinary writer or translator.</p>
<p>Because he is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whatever he writes becomes very effective.</p>
<p>The principle of being empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is essential.</p>
<p>A materialistic poet who describes in his poetry the material activities of man and woman cannot describe the transcendental pastimes of the Lord or the transcendental conclusions of devotional service.</p>
<p>Srila Sanatana Gosvami has therefore warned all neophyte devotees that one should not hear from the mouth of a non-Vaisnava avaisnava-mukhodgirnam</p>
<p>putam hari-kathamrtam</p>
<p>sravanam naiva kartavyam</p>
<p>sarpocchistam yatha payah (Padma Purana) Unless one is a fully unalloyed devotee of the Lord, one should not try to describe the pastimes of Krsna in poetry, for it will be only mundane.</p>
<p>There are many descriptions of Krsna’s Bhagavad-gita written by persons whose consciousness is mundane and who are not qualified by pure devotion.</p>
<p>Although they attempted to write transcendental literature, they could not fully engage even a single devotee in Krsna’s service.</p>
<p>Such literature is mundane, and therefore, as warned by Sri Sanatana Gosvami, one should not touch it.</p>

<p>The Chastisement of Junior Haridasa The purport of this chapter is explained by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura in his Amrta-pravaha-bhasya as follows.</p>
<p>Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami, the author of Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, wanted to explain direct meetings with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, meetings with those empowered by Him, and His avirbhava appearance.</p>
<p>Thus he described the glories of Nrsimhananda and other devotees.</p>
<p>A devotee named Bhagavan Acarya was exceptionally faithful to the lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his brother, Gopala Bhatta Acarya, discoursed upon the commentary of impersonalism (Mayavada).</p>
<p>Srila Svarupa Damodara Gosvami, the secretary of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, forbid Bhagavan Acarya to indulge in hearing that commentary.</p>
<p>Later, when Junior Haridasa, following the order of Bhagavan Acarya, went to collect alms from Madhavidevi, he committed an offense by talking intimately with a woman although he was in the renounced order.</p>
<p>Because of this, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu rejected Junior Haridasa, and despite all the requests of the Lord’s stalwart devotees, the Lord did not accept him again.</p>
<p>One year after this incident, Junior Haridasa went to the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna and committed suicide.</p>
<p>In his spiritual body, however, he continued to sing devotional songs, and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu heard them.</p>
<p>When the Vaisnavas of Bengal went to see Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, these incidents became known to Svarupa Damodara and others.</p>
