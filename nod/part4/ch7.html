                        <h3><a class="header" href="#perverted-expression-of-mellows" id="perverted-expression-of-mellows">Perverted Expression of Mellows</a></h3>
<p>Rasābhāsa, or incompatible mixtures of mellows, may be classified as uparasa (false expression) anurasa (imitation) and aparasa (perverted or misrepresented mellows).</p>
<p>There is the following statement by an impersonalist who had just seen Kṛṣṇa: &quot;When a person has passed completely from all contamination of material existence, he relishes a transcendental bliss of being established in trance.</p>
<p>But as soon as I saw You, the original Personality of Godhead, I experienced the same bliss.&quot; This perverted reflection of mellows is called śānta-uparasa, or a perverted reflection of mixed impersonalism and personalism.</p>
<p>There is another statement as follows: &quot;Wherever I am glancing I simply see Your personality.</p>
<p>Therefore I know You are the uncontaminated Brahman effulgence, the supreme cause of all causes.</p>
<p>I think there is nothing but You in this cosmic manifestation.&quot; This is another example of uparasa, or a perverted reflection of impersonalism and personalism.</p>
<p>When Madhumaṅgala, an intimate friend of Kṛṣṇa, was dancing before Kṛṣṇa in a joking manner, no one was paying attention to him, and he jokingly said, &quot;My dear Lord, please be merciful upon me.</p>
<p>I am praying for Your mercy.&quot; This is an example of uparasa in fraternal affection and neutrality.</p>
<p>Kaṁsa once addressed his sister Devakī as follows: &quot;My dear sister, having seen your dear son Kṛṣṇa, I think that He is so strong that He can kill even wrestlers strong as the mountains.</p>
<p>So I will have no more anxieties about Him, even if He is engaged in a terrible fight.&quot; This is an instance of uparasa in a perverted reflection of parental love.</p>
<p>In the Lalita-mādhava, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī says, &quot;The wives of the yajñic brāhmaṇas were all young girls, and they were attracted to Kṛṣṇa in the same way as the gopīs of Vṛndāvana.</p>
<p>Out of their attraction they distributed food to Kṛṣṇa.&quot; Here the two devotional mellows are conjugal love and parental love, and the result is called upa-rasa in conjugal love.</p>
<p>One of the friends of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī told Her, &quot;My dear friend Gāndharvikā [Rādhārāṇī], You were the most chaste girl in our village, but now You have divided Yourself and are partially chaste and partially unchaste.</p>
<p>It is all due to Cupid's influence upon You after You saw Kṛṣṇa and heard the sound of His flute.&quot; This is another example of uparasa caused by divided interests in conjugal love.</p>
<p>According to some expert learned scholars, the feelings between lover and beloved create perverted reflections of mellows in many ways.</p>
<p>&quot;The gopīs have become purified by Kṛṣṇa's glance, and as such, Cupid's influence is distinctly visible on their bodies.&quot; Although in the material sense the glancing of a boy at a girl is a kind of pollution, when Kṛṣṇa threw His transcendental glance at the gopīs, they became purified.</p>
<p>In other words, because Kṛṣṇa is the absolute truth, any action by Him is transcendentally pure.</p>
<p>After Kṛṣṇa chastised the Kāliyanāga in the Yamunā River by dancing on his heads, the Kāliyanāga's wives addressed Kṛṣṇa, &quot;My dear cowherd boy, we are all only young wives of the Kāliyanāga, so why do You agitate our minds by sounding Your flute?&quot; Kāliya's wives were flattering Kṛṣṇa so that He would spare their husband.</p>
<p>Therefore this is an example of uparasa, or imitation.</p>
<p>One devotee said, &quot;My dear Govinda, here is a nice flowery bush in Kailāsa.</p>
<p>I am a young girl, and You are a young poetic boy.</p>
<p>After this, what more can I say? You just consider.&quot; This is an example of uparasa, caused by impudency in conjugal love.</p>
<p>When Nārada Muni was passing through Vṛndāvana, he came to the Bhāṇḍīravana Forest and saw in one of the trees the famous parrot couple that always accompanies Lord Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>The couple was imitating some discussion they heard upon the Vedānta philosophy, and thus were seemingly arguing upon various philosophical points.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, Nārada Muni was struck with wonder, and he began to stare without moving his eyelids.</p>
<p>This is an example of anurasa, or imitation.</p>
<p>When Kṛṣṇa was fleeing away from the battlefield, from a distant place Jarāsandha was watching Him with restless eyes and was feeling very proud.</p>
<p>Being thus puffed up with his conquest, he was repeatedly laughing.</p>
<p>This is an example of aparasa.</p>
<p>Everything in connection with Kṛṣṇa is called ecstatic devotional love, although it may be exhibited in different ways: sometimes in right order and sometimes as a perverted reflection.</p>
<p>According to the opinion of all expert devotees, anything that will arouse ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa is to be taken as an impetus for transcendental mellow.</p>
<p>Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta summary study of Śrī Bhakti-rasāmṛtasindhu by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī.</p>
<p>Concluding Words Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī concludes by saying that Bhakti-rasāmṛta- sindhu is very difficult for ordinary men to understand, yet he hopes that Lord Kṛṣṇa, the eternal Supreme Personality of Godhead, will be pleased with his presentation of this book.</p>
<p>By rough calculation it is estimated that Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī finished Śrī Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu in Gokula Vṛndāvana in the year 1552.</p>
<p>While physically present, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī was living in different parts of Vṛndāvana, and his headquarters were in the temple of Rādhā-Dāmodara in the present city of Vṛndāvana.</p>
<p>The place of Rūpa Gosvāmī's bhajana, execution of devotional service, is commemorated still.</p>
<p>There are two different tomb-like structures in the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple; one structure is called his place of bhajana, and in the other his body is entombed.</p>
<p>Behind this very tomb I have my place of bhajana, but since 1965 I have been away.</p>
<p>The place, however, is being taken care of by my disciples.</p>
<p>By Kṛṣṇa's will, I am now residing at the Los Angeles temple of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.</p>
<p>This purport is finished today, the 30th of June, 1969.</p>
