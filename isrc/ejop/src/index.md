# Preface

The antimaterial particle within the material body passes from boyhood to youth to old age, leaves the old unworkable body and takes up another one.

Lord Kṛṣṇa imparted this knowledge to the sun god, vivasvān who instructed Manu, the father of mankind, who in turn instructed Ikṣvāku.

Master yogīs can give up their bodies at will and enter the antimaterial worlds, while the gross materialists cannot even approach the higher material planets with their space vehicles.

Bhakti-yoga has been made easy to practice, especially in this iron age, by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself in His most sublime, liberal and munificent appearance as Lord Śrī Caitanya.

There are unlimited Vaikuṇṭha planets in the spiritual sky, and their ratio to the material planets is three to one.

The Supreme Being is the all-attractive Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

One may take an easy journey to the spiritual planets, where he can associate with the Personality of Godhead in full bliss and knowledge for eternity.

A living being, especially civilized man, has a natural desire to live forever in happiness.

This is quite natural because, in his original state, the living being is both eternal and joyful.

However, in the present conditioned state of life, he is engaged in a struggle against recurring birth and death.

Therefore he has attained neither happiness nor immortality.

The latest desire man has developed is the desire to travel to other planets.

This is also quite natural, because he has the constitutional right to go to any part of the material or spiritual skies.

Such travel is very tempting and exciting because these skies are full of unlimited globes of varying qualities, and they are occupied by all types of living entities.

The desire to travel there can be fulfilled by the process of yoga, which serves as a means by which one can transfer himself to whatever planet he likes-possibly to planets where life is not only eternal and blissful, but where there are multiple varieties of enjoyable energies.

Anyone who can attain the freedom of the spiritual planets need never return to this miserable land of birth, old age, disease and death.

One can attain this stage of perfection very easily by his individual effort.

He can simply follow, in his own home, the prescribed method of bhakti-yoga.

This method, under proper guidance, is simple and enjoyable.

An attempt is made herein to give information to the people in general, and to philosophers and religionists in particular, as to how one can transfer oneself to other planets by this process of bhakti-yoga-the highest of all yogic processes.
