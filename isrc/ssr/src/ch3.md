# Discovering the Roots

## The Immortal Nectar of the Bhagavad-gita

Through the centuries, India's greatest philosophers and spiritualists have praised the Bhagavad-gita as the distilled essence of the eternal Vedic wisdom.

In his Meditations on the Bhagavad-gita, versified here, the renowned sixth-century philosopher Sankara glorifies the Gita and its divine author, Sri Krishna.

Although universally celebrated as an impersonalist, here Sankara reveals his devotion to the original personal form of God, Lord Sri Krishna.

And Srila Prabhupada elucidates.

### 1

O Bhagavad-gita, Through Thy eighteen chapters Thou showerest upon man The immortal nectar Of the wisdom of the Absolute.

O blessed Gita, By Thee, Lord Krishna Himself Enlightened Arjuna.

Afterward, the ancient sage Vyasa Included Thee in the Mahabharata.

O loving mother, Destroyer of man's rebirth Into the darkness of this mortal world, Upon Thee I meditate.

### 2

Salutations to thee, O Vyasa.

Thou art of mighty intellect, And thine eyes Are large as the petals Of the full-blown lotus.

It was thou Who brightened this lamp of wisdom, Filling it with the oil Of the Mahabharata.

Purport Sripada Sankaracarya was an impersonalist from the materialistic point of view.

But he never denied the spiritual form known as sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, or the eternal, allblissful form of knowledge that existed before the material creation.

When he spoke of Supreme Brahman as impersonal, he meant that the Lord's sac-cid-ananda form was not to be confused with a material conception of personality.

In the very beginning of his commentary on the Gita, he maintains that Narayana, the Supreme Lord, is transcendental to the material creation.

The Lord existed before the creation as the transcendental personality, and He has nothing to do with material personality.

Lord Krishna is the same Supreme Personality, and He has no connection with a material body.

He descends in His spiritual, eternal form, but foolish people mistake His body to be like ours.

Sankara's preaching of impersonalism is especially meant for teaching foolish persons who consider Krishna to be an ordinary man composed of matter.

No one would care to read the Gita if it had been spoken by a material man, and certainly Vyasadeva would not have bothered to incorporate it into the history of the Mahabharata.

According to the above verses, Mahabharata is the history of the ancient world, and Vyasadeva is the writer of this great epic.

The Bhagavad-gita is identical with Krishna; and because Krishna is the Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no difference between Krishna and His words.

Therefore the Bhagavad-gita is as worshipable as Lord Krishna Himself, both being absolute.

One who hears the Bhagavad-gita "as is" actually hears the words directly from the lotus lips of the Lord.

But unfortunate persons say that the Gita is too antiquated for the modern man, who wants to find out God by speculation or meditation.

### 3

I salute Thee, O Krishna, O Thou who art the refuge Of ocean-born Laksmi And all who take refuge At Thy lotus feet.

Thou art indeed The wish-fulfilling tree For Thy devotee.

Thy one hand holds a staff For driving cows, And Thy other hand is raised-The thumb touching the tip Of Thy forefinger, Indicating divine knowledge.

Salutations to Thee, O Supreme Lord, For Thou art the milker Of the ambrosia of the Gita.

Purport Sripada Sankaracarya explicitly says, "You fools, just worship Govinda and that Bhagavad-gita spoken by Narayana Himself," yet foolish people still conduct their research work to find out Narayana; consequently they are wretched, and they waste their time for nothing.

Narayana is never wretched nor daridra; rather, He is worshiped by the goddess of fortune, Laksmi, as well as by all living entities.

Sankara declared himself to be "Brahman," but he admits Narayana, or Krishna, to be the Supreme Personality who is beyond the material creation.

He offers his respects to Krishna as the Supreme Brahman, or Parabrahman, because He (Krishna) is worshipable by everyone.

Only the fools and enemies of Krishna, who cannot understand what the Bhagavad-gita is (though they make commentaries on it), say, "It is not the personal Krishna to whom we have to surrender ourselves utterly, but the unborn, beginningless Eternal who speaks through Krishna." Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.

Whereas Sankara, the greatest of the impersonalists, offers his due respects to Krishna and His book the Bhagavad-gita, the foolish say that "we need not surrender to the personal Krishna." Such unenlightened people do not know that Krishna is absolute and that there is no difference between His inside and outside.

The difference of inside and outside is experienced in the dual, material world.

In the absolute world there is no such difference, because in the absolute everything is spiritual (sac-cid-ananda), and Narayana, or Krishna, belongs to the absolute world.

In the absolute world there is only the factual personality, and there is no distinction between body and soul.

### 4

The Upanisads Are as a herd of cows, Lord Krishna, son of a cowherd, Is their milker, Arjuna is the calf, The supreme nectar of the Gita Is the milk, And the wise man Of purified intellect Is the drinker.

Purport Unless one understands spiritual variegatedness, one cannot understand the transcendental pastimes of the Lord.

In the Brahma-samhita it is said that Krishna's name, form, quality, pastimes, entourage, and paraphernalia are all ananda-cinmayarasa--in short, everything of His transcendental association is of the same composition of spiritual bliss, knowledge, and eternity.

There is no end to His name, form, etc., unlike in the material world, where all things have their end.

As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, only fools deride Him; whereas it is Sankara, the greatest impersonalist, who worships Him, His cows, and His pastimes as the son of Vasudeva and pleasure of Devaki.

### 5

Thou son of Vasudeva, Destroyer of the demons Kamsa and Canura, Thou supreme bliss of Mother Devaki, O Thou, guru of the universe, Teacher of the worlds, Thee, O Krishna, I salute.

Purport Sankara describes Him as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki.

Does he mean thereby that he is worshiping an ordinary, material man? He worships Krishna because he knows that Krishna's birth and activities are all supernatural.

As stated in the Bhagavadgita (4.9), Krishna's birth and activities are mysterious and transcendental, and therefore only the devotees of Krishna can know them perfectly.

Sankara was not such a fool that he would accept Krishna as an ordinary man and at the same time offer Him all devotional obeisances, knowing Him as the son of Devaki and Vasudeva.

According to the Bhagavad-gita, only by knowing the transcendental birth and activities of Krishna can one attain liberation by acquiring a spiritual form like Krishna's.

There are five different kinds of liberation.

One who merges into the spiritual auras of Krishna, known as the impersonal Brahman effulgence, does not fully develop his spiritual body.

But one who fully develops his spiritual existence becomes an associate of Narayana or Krishna in different spiritual abodes.

One who enters into the abode of Narayana develops a spiritual form exactly like Narayana's (four-handed), and one who enters into the highest spiritual abode of Krishna, known as Goloka Vrndavana, develops a spiritual form of two hands like Krishna's.

Sankara, as an incarnation of Lord Siva, knows all these spiritual existences, but he did not disclose them to his then Buddhist followers because it was impossible for them to know about the spiritual world.

Lord Buddha preached that void is the ultimate goal, so how could his followers understand spiritual variegatedness? Therefore Sankara said, brahma satyam jagan mithya, or, material variegatedness is false but spiritual variegatedness is fact.

In the Padma Purana Lord Siva has admitted that he had to preach the philosophy of maya, or illusion, in the Kali-yuga as another edition of the "void" philosophy of Buddha.

He had to do this by the order of the Lord for specific reasons.

He disclosed his real mind, however, by recommending that people worship Krishna, for no one can be saved simply by mental speculations composed of word jugglery and grammatical maneuvers.

Sankara further instructs: bhaja govindam bhaja govindam bhaja govindam mudha-mate samprapte sannihite kale na hi na hi raksati dukrn-karane "You intellectual fools, just worship Govinda, just worship Govinda, just worship Govinda.

Your grammatical knowledge and word jugglery will not save you at the time of death."

### 6

Of that terrifying river Of the battlefield of Kuruksetra Over which the Pandavas victoriously crossed, Bhisma and Drona were as the high banks, Jayadratha as the river's water, The King of Gandhara the blue water-lily, Salya the shark, Krpa the current, Karna the mighty waves, Asvatthama and Vikarna the dread alligators, And Duryodhana the very whirlpool-But Thou, O Krishna, wast the ferryman!

### 7

May the spotless lotus of the Mahabharata That grows on the waters Of the words of Vyasa And of which the Bhagavad-gita Is the irresistibly sweet fragrance And its tales of heroes The full-blown petals Fully opened by the talk of Lord Hari, Who destroys the sins Of Kali-yuga, And on which daily light The nectar-seeking souls, As so many bees Swarming joyously-May this lotus of the Mahabharata Bestow on us the highest good.

### 8

Salutations to Lord Krishna The embodiment of supreme bliss, By whose grace and compassion The dumb become eloquent And the lame scale mountains-Him I salute! Purport Foolish followers of foolish speculators cannot understand the meaning of offering salutations to Lord Krishna, the embodiment of bliss.

Sankara himself offered his salutations to Lord Krishna so that some of his intelligent followers might understand the real fact by the example set by their great master, Sankara, the incarnation of Lord Siva.

But there are many obstinate followers of Sankara who refuse to offer their salutations to Lord Krishna and instead mislead innocent persons by injecting materialism into the Bhagavad-gita and confusing innocent readers by their commentaries, and consequently the readers never have the opportunity to become blessed by offering salutations to Lord Krishna, the cause of all causes.

The greatest disservice to humanity is to keep mankind in darkness about the science of Krishna, or Krishna consciousness, by distorting the sense of the Gita.

### 9

Salutations to that supreme shining one Whom the creator Brahma, Varuna, Indra, Rudra, Marut, and all divine beings Praise with hymns, Whose glories are sung By the verses of the Vedas, Of whom the singers of Sama sing And of whose glories the Upanisads Proclaim in full choir, Whom the yogis see With their minds absorbed In perfect meditation, And of whom all the hosts Of gods and demons Know not the limitations.

To Him, the Supreme God, Krishna, be all salutations-Him we salute! Him we salute! Him we salute! Purport By recitation of the ninth verse of his meditation, quoted from the SrimadBhagavatam, Sankara has indicated that Lord Krishna is worshipable by one and all, including himself.

He gives hints to materialists, impersonalists, mental speculators, "void" philosophers, and all other candidates subjected to the punishment of material miseries--just offer salutations to Lord Krishna, who is worshiped by Brahma, Siva, Varuna, Indra, and all other demigods.

He has not mentioned, however, the name of Visnu, because Visnu is identical with Krishna.

The Vedas and the Upanisads are meant for understanding the process by which one can surrender unto Krishna.

The yogis try to see Him (Krishna) within themselves by meditation.

In other words, it is for all the demigods and demons who do not know where the ultimate end is that Sankara teaches, and he especially instructs the demons and the fools to offer salutations to Krishna and His words, the Bhagavad-gita, by following in his footsteps.

Only by such acts will the demons be benefited, not by misleading their innocent followers by socalled mental speculations or show-bottle meditations.

Sankara directly offers salutations to Krishna, as if to show the fools, who are searching after light, that here ls light like the sun.

But the fallen demons are like owls that will not open their eyes on account of their fear of the sunlight itself.

These owls will never open their eyes to see the sublime light of Krishna and His words the Bhagavad-gita.

They will, however, comment on the Gita with their closed owl-eyes to mislead their unfortunate readers and followers.

Sankara, however, discloses the light to his less intelligent followers and shows that the Bhagavad-gita and Krishna are the only source of light.

This is all to teach the sincere seekers of truth to offer salutation to Lord Krishna and thus surrender unto Him without misgivings.

That is the highest perfection of life, and that is the highest teaching of Sankara, the great learned scholar whose teachings drove the voidist philosophy of Buddha out of India, the land of knowledge.

Om tat sat.

## The Scriptural Basis of Krishna Consciousness

On January 11, 1970, an article in the Los Angeles Times reported that faculty members at the University of California at Berkeley, including Dr.J.F.Staal, professor of philosophy and South Asian languages, had turned down a request to grant credit for an experimental course in Krishna consciousness to have been taught by Hans Kary, president of the Hare Krishna movement's Berkeley center.

In rejecting the proposed course, Dr.Staal suggested that the devotees "spend too much time chanting to develop a philosophy." When the article came to the attention of Srila Prabhupada, the founder and spiritual master of the Hare Krishna movement, he initiated an unusual correspondence with the renowned professor.

Excerpt from the Los Angeles Times Article "Dr.J.F.Staal, Professor of Philosophy and Near Eastern [sic] Languages at UC Berkeley and an instructor in Indian philosophy, believes that the Krishna sect is an authentic Indian religion and that its adherents are sincere.

He attributes the Society's rapid increase in members to the tendency of today's younger generation to reject organized churchgoing while at the same time searching for fulfillment of a belief in mysticism.

"He points out, however, that persons who turn away from Christianity, Muhammadanism, and Judaism have usually lost faith with the personal god of those religions and are looking for a mystical religion without absolutes.

"'These people in the Krishna movement have turned to Hinduism, but, curiously, it is a cult that is highly personalistic,' Staal said.

'They accept a personal god, Krishna, and Christianity has that.

I feel that they have transferred some of their Christian background to a Hindu sect.' "He also feels that they spend too much time chanting to develop a philosophy.

On these grounds he and others on the faculty turned down the request to grant credit for an experimental course in Krishna consciousness that will be taught during the winter quarter by Hans Kary, president of the sect's Berkeley temple." Srila Prabhupada's Letter to the Los Angeles Times January 14, 1970 Editor Los Angeles Times Dear Sir: With reference to your article in the Los Angeles Times dated Sunday, January 11, 1970, under the heading "Krishna Chant," I beg to point out that the Hindu religion is perfectly based on the personal conception of God, or Visnu.

The impersonal conception of God is a side issue, or one of the three features of God.

The Absolute Truth is ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Paramatma conception is the localized aspect of His omnipresence, and the impersonal conception is the aspect of His greatness and eternity.

But all these combined together make the Complete Whole.

Dr.J.F.Staal's statement that the Krishna cult is a combination of Christian and Hindu religion, as if something manufactured by concoction, is not correct.

If Christian, Muhammadan, or Buddhist religions are personal, that is quite welcome.

But the Krishna religion has been personal from a time long, long ago when Christian, Muhammadan, and Buddhist religions had not yet come into existence.

According to the Vedic conception, religion is basically made by the personal God as His laws.

Religion cannot be manufactured by man or anyone except God superior to man.

Religion is the law of God only.

Unfortunately, all the svamis who came before me in this country stressed the impersonal aspect of God, without sufficient knowledge of God's personal aspect.

In the Bhagavad-gita, therefore, it is said that only less intelligent persons consider that God is originally impersonal but assumes a form when He incarnates.

The Krishna philosophy, however, based on the authority of the Vedas, is that originally the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

His plenary expansion is present in everyone's heart in His localized aspect, and the impersonal Brahman effulgence is the transcendental light and heat distributed everywhere.

In the Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said that the aim of the Vedic way of searching out the Absolute Truth is to find the personal God.

One who is satisfied only with the other aspects of the Absolute Truth, namely the Paramatma feature or the Brahman feature, is to be considered possessed of a poor fund of knowledge.

Recently we have published our Sri Isopanisad, a Vedic literature, and in this small booklet we have thoroughly discussed this point.

As far as the Hindu religion is concerned, there are millions of Krishna temples in India, and there is not a single Hindu who does not worship Krishna.

Therefore, this Krishna consciousness movement is not a concocted idea.

We invite all scholars, philosophers, religionists, and members of the general public to understand this movement by critical study.

And if one does so seriously, one will understand the sublime position of this great movement.

The chanting process is also authorized.

Professor Staal's feeling of disgust in the matter of constant chanting of the holy name of Krishna is a definite proof of his lack of knowledge in this authorized movement of Krishna consciousness.

Instead of turning down the request to give Kary's course credit, he and all other learned professors of the University of California at Berkeley should patiently hear about the truth of this authorized movement so much needed at present in godless society.

[Credit for the course was later established.] This is the only movement which can save the confused younger generation.

I shall invite all responsible guardians of this country to understand this transcendental movement and then give us all honest facilities to spread it for everyone's benefit.

## The Exchange Between Srila Prabhupada and Dr.Staal

January 23, 1970

Swami A.C.Bhaktivedanta

Dear Swamiji: Thank you very much for sending me a copy of your letter to the Los Angeles Times, now also published in the Daily Californian.

I think you will agree with me that apart from publicity, little is gained by discussing religious or philosophic issues through interviews and letters in the press; but allow me to make two brief observations.

First, I know that devotion to Krishna is old (though definitely not as old as the Vedas) and has never been influenced by Christianity, Islam, or Judaism (I never referred to Buddhism in this connection).

The differences between the personal and impersonal are relatively vague, but adopting this distinction for simplicity, I expressed surprise at seeing people who have grown up in a Western culture which stresses the personal take to an Indian cult which does the same.

I am less surprised when people who are dissatisfied with Western monotheism take to an Indian philosophy which stresses an impersonal absolute.

Second, I never expressed nor felt disgust at the chanting of the name of Krishna.

I am not only not irritated at it (like some people), but I rather like it.

But it is an indisputable fact that the Bhagavad-gita (not to mention the Vedas) does not require such constant chanting.

The Gita deals with quite different subjects, which I treat at some length in my courses on the philosophies of India.

Thanking you,

Yours sincerely,

J.F.Staal

Professor of Philosophy and of South Asian Languages

January 30, 1970

J.F.Staal

Professor of Philosophy and of South Asian Languages University of California Berkeley, California

My dear Professor Staal: I thank you very much for your kind letter dated January 23, 1970.

In the last paragraph of your letter you have mentioned that you are not irritated at the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra (like some people), but rather like it.

This has given me much satisfaction, and I am sending herewith a copy of our magazine, Back to Godhead, issue number 28, in which you will find how the students [at a program at Ohio State University] liked this chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra, although all of them were neophytes to this cult of chanting.

Actually this chanting is very pleasing to the heart and is the best means of infusing spiritual consciousness, or Krishna consciousness, into the hearts of people in general.

This is the easiest process of spiritual realization and is recommended in the Vedas.

In the Brhan-naradiya Purana it is clearly stated that it is only chanting of the holy name of Hari [Krishna] that can save people from the problems of materialistic existence, and there is no other alternative, no other alternative, no other alternative in this age of Kali.

Western culture is monotheistic, but Westerners are being misled by impersonal Indian speculation.

The young people of the West are frustrated because they are not diligently taught about monotheism.

They are not satisfied with this process of teaching and understanding.

The Krishna consciousness movement is a boon to them, because they are being really trained to understand Western monotheism under the authoritative Vedic system.

We do not simply theoretically discuss; rather, we learn by the prescribed method of Vedic regulations.

But I am surprised to see that in the last paragraph of your letter you say, "It is an indisputable fact that the Bhagavad-gita (not to mention the Vedas) does not require such constant chanting." I think that you have missed the following verse in the Bhagavad-gita, apart from many other similar verses: satatam kirtayanto mam yatantas ca drdha-vratah namasyantas ca mam bhaktya nitya-yukta upasate (Bg.9.14) The engagement of the great souls, freed from delusion and perfect in their realization of God, is described here: satatam kirtayanto mam--they are always (satatam) chanting (kirtayantah) My glories and--nitya-yukta upasate--always worshiping Me (Krishna).

So I do not know how you can say "indisputable." And, if you want references from the Vedas, I can give you many.

In the Vedas, the chief transcendental vibration omkara is also Krishna.

Pranava omkara is the divine substance of the Vedas.

Following the Vedas means chanting the Vedic mantras, and no Vedic mantra is complete without omkara.

In the Mandukya Upanisad, omkara is stated to be the most auspicious sound representation of the Supreme Lord.

This is also confirmed again in the Atharva Veda.

Omkara is the sound representation of the Supreme Lord and is therefore the principal word in the Vedas.

In this connection, the Supreme Lord, Krishna, says, pranavah sarva-vedesu: "I am the syllable om in all the Vedic mantras." (Bg.7.8) Furthermore, in Bhagavad-gita, Chapter Fifteen, verse 15, Krishna says, "I am seated in everyone's heart.

By all the Vedas, I am to be known; I am the compiler of Vedanta, and I know Veda as it is." The Supreme Lord, seated in everyone's heart, is described in both the Mundaka and Svetasvatara Upanisads: dva suparna sayuja sakhaya...

The Supreme Lord and the individual soul are sitting in the body like two friendly birds in a tree.

One bird is eating the fruits of the tree, or reactions of material activities, and the other bird, the Supersoul, is witnessing.

The goal of Vedantic study, therefore, is to know the Supreme Lord, Krishna.

This point is stressed in the Bhagavad-gita, Chapter Eight, verse 13, where it is stated that by the mystic yoga process, ultimately vibrating the sacred syllable om, one attains to His supreme spiritual planet.

In the Vedanta-sutras, which you have certainly read, the Fourth Chapter, adhikarana 4, sutra 22, states positively, anavrttih sabdat: "By sound vibration one becomes liberated." By devotional service, by understanding well the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can go to His abode and never come back again to this material condition.

How is it possible? The answer is, simply by chanting His name constantly.

This is accepted by the exemplary disciple, Arjuna, who has perfectly learned the conclusion of spiritual science from the yogesvara, the master of mystic knowledge, Krishna.

Recognizing Krishna to be the Supreme Brahman, Arjuna addresses Him, sthane hrsikesa...: "The world becomes joyful hearing Your name, and thus do all become attached to You." (Bg.11.36) The process of chanting is herein authorized as the direct means of contacting the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead.

Simply by chanting the holy name Krishna, the soul is attracted by the Supreme Person, Krishna, to go home, back to Godhead.

In the Narada-pancaratra it is stated that all the Vedic rituals, mantras, and understanding are compressed into the eight words Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare.

Similarly, in the Kali-santarana Upanisad it is stated that these sixteen words, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, are especially meant for counteracting the degrading and contaminating influence of this materialistic age of Kali.

All these points are elaborately presented in my book Teachings of Lord Caitanya.

The process of chanting is, therefore, not only the sublime method for practical perfection of life but the authorized Vedic principle inaugurated by the greatest Vedic scholar and devotee, Lord Caitanya (whom we consider an incarnation of Krishna).

We are simply following in His authorized footsteps.

The scope of the Krishna consciousness movement is universal.

The process for regaining one's original spiritual status of eternal life, full with bliss and knowledge, is not abstract, dry theorizing.

Spiritual life is not described in the Vedas as theoretical, dry, or impersonal.

The Vedas aim at the inculcation of pure love of God only, and this harmonious conclusion is practically realized by the Krishna consciousness movement, or by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra.

As the goal of spiritual realization is only one, love of God, so the Vedas stand as a single comprehensive whole in the matter of transcendental understanding.

Only the incomplete views of various parties apart from the bona fide Vedic lines of teaching give a rapturous appearance to the Bhagavad-gita.

The reconciliative factor adjusting all apparently diverse propositions of the Vedas is the essence of the Veda, or Krishna consciousness (love of God).

Thanking you once again,

Yours sincerely,

A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami

February 8, 1970

Swami A.C.Bhaktivedanta

Dear Swamiji: Thank you very much for your kindness in sending me your long and interesting letter of January 30, together with the last issue of Back to Godhead.

So far I have had a few discussions with members of your society here, but they were not entirely satisfactory from my point of view.

But now I have your much more authoritative letter, whereby the discussion moves to a higher level.

And yet, I am afraid, you have not convinced me that all the scriptures you quote prescribe only chanting of the name of Krishna.

Let me refer only to the most important ones.

In the Bhagavad-gita (9.14), kirtayantah need not mean chanting of the name of Krishna.

It may mean glorifying, chanting, reciting, talking, and refer to songs, hymns, descriptions, or conversations.

The commentators take it that way.

Sankara in his commentary merely repeats the word, but Anandagiri in his vyakhya classes kirtana as vedanta-sravanam pranava-japas ca, "listening to the Vedanta and muttering om" (that the Vedic om is Krishna is said in the Bhagavad-gita, where Krishna is also identified with many other things, and which is smrti, but not in the Vedas, which are sruti).

Another commentator, Hanuman, in his Paisaca-bhasya, says that kirtayantah merely means bhasamanah--"talking [about]." More important, I think, than the precise meaning of this word, is that the entire verse does not require that everyone always engage in kirtana, but merely states that some great souls do so.

This is obvious from the next verse, which states that anye, "others," engage in jnana: yajnena...

yajanto mam, "worshiping me...

with the worship of knowledge." The Bhagavad-gita is broad-minded and tolerant of a variety of religious approaches, although it also stresses one aspect above all others (i.e., sarva-phalatyaga).

Finally, in the last sutra of the Vedanta-sutra, anavrttih sabdat..., sabda refers to the scripture or to the revelation of the Vedas, as is clear from the context and from the commentators.

Sankara quotes a number of texts (ending with ity adi-sabdebhyah, "according to these sabdas") to support this, i.e., to support the statement that "according to the scripture there is no return." He also refers to sabda in this sutra by saying mantrartha-vadadi..., "mantras, descriptions, etc." Vacaspati Misra in the Bhamati supports this and clarifies it further by adding that a contrary view is sruti-smrtivirodhah, "in conflict with the smrti and the sruti." Thanking you once again for your kind attention.

Yours very sincerely,

J.F.Staal

February 15, 1970

J.F.Staal

Professor of Philosophy and of South Asian Languages

My dear Dr.Staal: I am very glad to receive your letter dated Sunday, February 8, 1970.

I am very much pleased also to note the contents.

Regarding convincing you that all scriptures prescribe chanting of the name of Krishna, I can simply present the authority of Lord Caitanya.

Lord Caitanya recommended, kirtaniyah sada harih ("Hari, Krishna, is constantly to be praised" (Siksastaka 3)).

Similarly, Madhvacarya quotes, vede ramayane caiva harih sarvatra giyate ["Hari is sung about everywhere in the Vedas and Ramayana").

Similarly, in the Bhagavad-gita (15.15) the Lord says, vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah ("By all the Vedas, I am to be known"].

In this way we find all the scriptures aiming at the Supreme Person.

In the Rg Veda (1.22.20) the mantra is om tad visnoh paramam padam sada pasyanti surayah ("The demigods are always looking to that supreme abode of Visnu"].

The whole Vedic process, therefore, is to understand Lord Visnu, and any scripture is directly or indirectly chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord, Visnu.

Regarding the Bhagavad-gita, verse 9.14, kirtayantah certainly means glorifying, chanting, reciting, and talking, as you have said; but glorifying, chanting, or reciting about whom? It is certainly Krishna.

The word used in this connection is mam ["Me"].

Therefore, we do not disagree when a person glorifies Krishna, as Sukadeva did in the Srimad-Bhagavatam.

This is also kirtana.

The highest among all Vedic literatures is the proper place for such glorification of the Supreme Lord, Krishna, and this is to be well understood from the verse: nigama-kalpa-taror galitam phalam suka-mukhad amrta-drava-samyutam pibata bhagavatam rasam alayam muhur aho rasika bhuvi bhavukah "O expert and thoughtful men, relish Srimad-Bhagavatam, the mature fruit of the desire tree of Vedic literatures.

It emanated from the lips of Sri Sukadeva Gosvami.

Therefore this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls." (Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.1.3) It is said that Maharaja Pariksit attained salvation simply by hearing, and similarly Sukadeva Gosvami attained salvation simply by chanting.

In our devotional service there are nine different methods for achieving the same goal, love of Godhead, and the first process is hearing.

This hearing process is called sruti.

The next process is chanting.

The chanting process is smrti.

We accept both sruti and smrti simultaneously.

We consider sruti the mother and smrti the sister, because a child hears from the mother and then again learns from the sister by description.

Sruti and smrti are two parallel lines.

Srila Rupa Gosvami therefore says: sruti-smrti-puranadipancaratra-vidhim vina aikantiki harer bhaktir utpatayaiva kalpate (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.101) That is, without references to sruti, smrti, Puranas, and Pancaratras, unadulterated devotional service is never achieved.

Therefore, anyone who shows a devotional ecstasy without reference to the sastras [Vedic scriptures] simply creates disturbances.

On the other hand, if we simply stick to the srutis, then we become veda-vada-ratah,] "Engaged in merely mouthing the words of the scriptures, but not understanding or practicing them."* who are not very much appreciated in the Bhagavad-gita.

Therefore Bhagavad-gita, although smrti, is the essence of all Vedic scripture, sarvopanisado gavah.

*See the Fourth of Sankaracarya's meditations.*

It is just like a cow which is delivering the milk, or the essence of all the Vedas and Upanisads, and all the acaryas, including Sankaracarya, accept the Bhagavad-gita as such.

Therefore you cannot deny the authority of the Bhagavad-gita because it is smrti; that view is sruti-smrti-virodhah, "in conflict with the smrti and the sruti," as you have correctly said.

Regarding Anandagiri's quotation that kirtana means vedanta-sravanam pranava japas ca ["listening to the Vedanta and muttering om"], the knower of Vedanta is Krishna, and He is the compiler of Vedanta.

He is veda-vit and vedanta-krt.

So where is there a greater opportunity for vedanta-sravana than to hear it from Krishna? Regarding the next verse, in which it is mentioned that jnana-yajnena...

yajanto mam, the object of worship is Krishna, as indicated by mam ["Me"].

The process is described in the Isopanisad, mantra 11: vidyam cavidyam ca yas tad vedobhayam saha avidyaya mrtyum tirtva vidyayamrtam asnute "Only one who can learn the process of nescience and that of transcendental knowledge side by side can transcend the influence of repeated birth and death and enjoy the full blessings of immortality." The culture of vidya, or transcendental knowledge, is essential for the human being, otherwise the culture of avidya, or nescience, binds him to conditional existence on the material platform.

Materialistic existence means the pursuit or culture of sense gratification, and this kind of knowledge of sense gratification (avidya) means advancement of repeated birth and death.

Those who are absorbed in such knowledge cannot learn any lesson from the laws of nature, and they do the same things over repeatedly, being enamored of the beauty of illusory things.

Vidya, or factual knowledge, on the other hand, means to know thoroughly the process of nescient activities while at the same time culturing transcendental science and thereby undeviatingly following the path of liberation.

Liberation is the enjoyment of the full blessings of immortality.

This immortality is enjoyed in the eternal kingdom of God (sambhuty-amrtam asnute), the region of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and is the result obtained by worshiping the Supreme Lord, the cause of all causes, sambhavat.

So in this way real knowledge, vidya, means to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna; that is jnana-yajnena, the worship of knowledge.

This jnana-yajnena...

yajanto mam is the perfection of knowledge, as stated in the Bhagavad-gita (7.19): bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah "After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me [Krishna], knowing Me to be the cause of all causes, and all that is.

Such a great soul is very rare." If one has not yet come to this conclusion of knowledge and simply indulges in dry speculation without Krishna, then his hard speculative labor is something like beating empty husks of grain.

The unhulled rice and the empty husks of rice look very much the same.

One who knows how to get the grain out of the unhulled rice is wise, but one who beats on the empty husk, thinking to get some result, is simply wasting his labor uselessly.

Similarly, if one studies the Vedas without finding the goal of the Vedas, Krishna, he simply wastes his valuable time.

So to cultivate knowledge for worshiping Krishna culminates after many, many births and deaths when one actually becomes wise.

When one becomes wise in this way, he surrenders to Krishna, recognizing Him at last to be the cause of all causes and all that is.

That sort of great soul is very rare.

So those who have surrendered to Krishna life and soul are rare sudurlabha mahatmas.

They are not ordinary mahatmas.

By the grace of Lord Caitanya that highest perfectional status of life is being distributed very freely.

The effect is also very encouraging; otherwise, how are boys and girls without any background of Vedic culture quickly occupying the posts of rare mahatmas simply by vibrating this transcendental sound, Hare Krishna? And simply on the basis of this chanting, the majority of them (those who are very sincere) are steady in devotional service and are not falling down to the four principles of material sinful life, namely (1) meat-eating, (2) illicit sexual connection, (3) taking of intoxicants, including coffee, tea, and tobacco, and (4) gambling.

And that is the last sutra of the Vedantasutra, i.e., anavrttih sabdat ["By sound vibration one becomes liberated"].

One has to learn by the result (phalena pariciyate).

Our students are ordered to act like this, and they are not falling down.

That they are remaining on the platform of pure spiritual life without hankering to culture the above principles of avidya, or sense gratification, is the test of their proper understanding of the Vedas.

They do not come back to the material platform, because they are relishing the nectarean fruit of love of God.

Sarva-phala-tyaga ["renunciation of all the fruits of one's work"] is explained in the Bhagavad-gita by the Lord Himself in the words sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: "Give up everything and simply surrender unto Me [Krishna]." The Hare Krishna mantra means "O Supreme Energy of Krishna and O Lord Krishna, please engage me in Your eternal service." So we have given up everything and are simply engaged in the service of the Lord.

What Krishna orders us to do is our only engagement.

We have given up all resultant actions of karma, jnana, and yoga; and that is the stage of pure devotional service, bhaktir uttama.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Swamiji: Thank you very much for your very interesting letter of February 15, 1970, with enclosure.

I am afraid that whenever you quote a passage purporting to show that only the chanting of the name Krishna is required, I can quote another one which requires something else, adding, yadi sloko 'pi pramanam, ayam api slokah pramanam bhavitum arhati: "If mere verses are authoritative, this verse also ought to be regarded as authoritative." And there may be no end to this in the foreseeable future, as Patanjali also says, mahan hi sabdasya prayoga-visayah: "For vast is the domain for the use of words."

Yours very sincerely,

J.F.Staal

Dear Dr.Staal: I beg to thank you very much for your kind letter dated February 25, 1970.

I am sorry that I could not reply to your letter earlier because I was a little busy in the matter of purchasing a new church estate at the above address.

We have secured a very nice place for a separate temple, lecture room, my quarters, and the devotees' residential quarters, all together in a nice place with all the modern amenities.

I beg to request you to visit this place at your convenience, and if you kindly let me know a day before, my students will be very glad to receive you properly.

Regarding our correspondence, actually this quotation and counter-quotation cannot solve the problem.

In a court both the learned lawyers quote from law books, but that is not the solution to the case.

The determination of the case is the judgment of the presiding judge.

So argument cannot bring us to a conclusion.

The scriptural quotations are sometimes contradictory, and every philosopher has a different opinion, because without putting forward a different thesis, no one can become a famous philosopher.

It is therefore difficult to arrive at the right conclusion.

The conclusion is, as above mentioned, to accept the judgment of authority.

We follow the authority of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is nondifferent from Krishna, and His version according to Vedic scripture is that in this age this chanting is the only solution for all problems of life.

And that is actually being shown by practical experience.

Recently there was a big procession of our students in Berkeley on the Advent Day of Lord Caitanya, and the public has remarked as follows: "This crowd of men is not like others, who assemble to break windows and create havoc." This is also confirmed by the police in the following words: "Members of the Krishna consciousness movement cooperated fully with the police, and their efforts to maintain peaceful order throughout the parade were so successful that only minimal police involvement was required." Similarly, in Detroit there was a big peace march, and our men were appreciated as "angels" in the crowd.

So this Krishna consciousness movement is actually needed at the present moment as the panacea for all kinds of problems in human society.

Other quotations will not act very appreciably at this time.

In a drugstore there may be many medicines, and all may be genuine, but what is required is that an experienced physician prescribe medicine for a particular patient.

We cannot say in this case, "This is also medicine, and this is also medicine." No.

The medicine which is effective for a particular person is the medicine for him--phalena pariciyate.

Yours very sincerely,

A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami

Final Note by Srila Prabhupada

In a court of justice two lawyers put forward their respective relevant arguments taken from the authorized law books to decide a point, but it is up to the judge to decide the case in favor of one of the litigants.

When the opposing lawyers put forward their arguments, both of them are legal and bona fide, but the judgment is given as to which argument is applicable to the particular case.

Lord Caitanya gives His judgment on the authority of sastras that the chanting of the holy names of the Lord is the only means to elevate one to the transcendental platform, and actually we can see it is effective.

Each and every one of our students who has seriously taken to this process may be examined individually, and any impartial judge will find it easy to see that they have advanced in their transcendental realization further than any philosophers, religionists, yogis, karmis, etc.

We have to accept everything favorable to the circumstances.

Rejection of other methods in a particular circumstance does not mean that the rejected ones are not bona fide.

But for the time being, taking into consideration the age, time, and object, methods are sometimes rejected even though bona fide.

We have to test everything by its practical result.

By such a test, in this age the constant chanting of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra undoubtedly proves very effective.

## Krishna Consciousness: Hindu Cult or Divine Culture?

When attempting to place the Krishna consciousness movement within a convenient historical-cultural context, many people identify the movement with Hinduism.

But this is misleading.

Srila Prabhupada disavows connection with the pantheism, polytheism, and caste consciousness that pervades modern Hinduism.

Although Krishna consciousness and modern Hinduism share a common historical root--India's ancient Vedic culture--Hinduism has become, along with the other "great religions," a sectarian establishment, whereas Krishna consciousness is universal and transcends relative, sectarian designations.

There is a misconception that the Krishna consciousness movement represents the Hindu religion.

In fact, however, Krishna consciousness is in no way a faith or religion that seeks to defeat other faiths or religions.

Rather, it is an essential cultural movement for the entire human society and does not consider any particular sectarian faith.

This cultural movement is especially meant to educate people in how they can love God.

Sometimes Indians both inside and outside of India think that we are preaching the Hindu religion, but actually we are not.

One will not find the word Hindu in the Bhagavad-gita.

Indeed, there is no such word as Hindu in the entire Vedic literature.

This word has been introduced by the Muslims from provinces next to India, such as Afghanistan, Baluchistan, and Persia.

There is a river called Sindhu bordering the north western provinces of India, and since the Muslims there could not pronounce Sindhu properly, they instead called the river Hindu, and the inhabitants of this tract of land they called Hindus.

In India, according to the Vedic language, the Europeans are called mlecchas or yavanas.

Similarly, Hindu is a name given by the Muslims.

India's actual culture is described in the Bhagavad-gita, where it is stated that according to the different qualities or modes of nature there are different types of men, who are generally classified into four social orders and four spiritual orders.

This system of social and spiritual division is known as varnasrama-dharma.

The four varnas, or social orders, are brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya.

and sudra.

The four asramas, or spiritual orders, are brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha, and sannyasa.

The varnasrama system is described in the Vedic scriptures known as the Puranas.

The goal of this institution of Vedic culture is to educate every man for advancement in knowledge of Krishna, or God.

That is the entire Vedic program.

When Lord Caitanya talked with the great devotee Ramananda Raya, the Lord asked him, "What is the basic principle of human life?" Ramananda Raya answered that human civilization begins when varnasrama-dharma is accepted.

Before coming to the standard of varnasrama-dharma there is no question of human civilization.

Therefore, the Krishna consciousness movement is trying to establish this right system of human civilization, which is known as Krishna consciousness, or daiva-varnasrama--divine culture.

In India, the varnasrama system has now been taken in a perverted way, and thus a man born in the family of a brahmana (the highest social order) claims that he should be accepted as a brahmana.

But this claim is not accepted by the sastra (scripture).

One's forefather may have been a brahmana according to gotra, or the family hereditary order, but real varnasrama-dharma is based on the factual quality one has attained, regardless of birth or heredity.

Therefore, we are not preaching the present-day system of the Hindus, especially those who are under the influence of Sankaracarya, for Sankaracarya taught that the Absolute Truth is impersonal, and thus he indirectly denied the existence of God.

Sankaracarya's mission was special; he appeared to reestablish the Vedic influence after the influence of Buddhism.

Because Buddhism was patronized by Emperor Asoka, twenty-six hundred years ago the Buddhist religion practically pervaded all of India.

According to the Vedic literature, Buddha was an incarnation of Krishna who had a special power and who appeared for a special purpose.

His system of thought, or faith, was accepted widely, but Buddha rejected the authority of the Vedas.

While Buddhism was spreading, the Vedic culture was stopped both in India and in other places.

Therefore, since Sankaracarya's only aim was to drive away Buddha's system of philosophy, he introduced a system called Mayavada.

Strictly speaking, Mayavada philosophy is atheism, for it is a process in which one imagines that there is God.

This Mayavada system of philosophy has been existing since time immemorial.

The present Indian system of religion or culture is based on the Mayavada philosophy of Sankaracarya, which is a compromise with Buddhist philosophy.

According to Mayavada philosophy there actually is no God, or if God exists, He is impersonal and all-pervading and can therefore be imagined in any form.

This conclusion is not in accord with the Vedic literature.

That literature names many demigods, who are worshiped for different purposes, but in every case the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, Visnu, is accepted as the supreme controller.

That is real Vedic culture.

The philosophy of Krishna consciousness does not deny the existence of God and the demigods, but Mayavada philosophy denies both; it maintains that neither the demigods nor God exists.

For the Mayavadis, ultimately all is zero.

They say that one may imagine any authority--whether Visnu, Durga, Lord Siva, or the sun-god--because these are the demigods generally worshiped in society.

But the Mayavada philosophy does not in fact accept the existence of any of them.

The Mayavadis say that because one cannot concentrate one's mind on the impersonal Brahman, one may imagine any of these forms.

This is a new system, called pancopasana.

It was introduced by Sankaracarya, but the Bhagavad-gita does not teach any such doctrines, and therefore they are not authoritative.

The Bhagavad-gita accepts the existence of the demigods.

The demigods are described in the Vedas, and one cannot deny their existence, but they are not to be understood or worshiped according to the way of Sankaracarya.

The worship of demigods is rejected in the Bhagavad-gita.

The Gita (7.20) clearly states: kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante 'nya-devatah tam tam niyamam asthaya prakrtya niyatah svaya "Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures." Furthermore, in the Bhagavad-gita (2.44), Lord Krishna states: bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam tayapahrta-cetasam vyavasayatmika buddhih samadhau na vidhiyate "In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination for devotional service does not take place." Those who are pursuing the various demigods have been described as hrta jnanah, which means "those who have lost their sense." That is also further explained in the Bhagavad-gita (7.23): antavat tu phalam tesam tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam devan deva-yajo yanti mad-bhakta yanti mam api "Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary.

Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees reach My supreme abode." The rewards given by the demigods are temporary, because any material facility must act in connection with the temporary body.

Whatever material facilities one gets, whether by modern scientific methods or by deriving benedictions from the demigods, will be finished with the body.

But spiritual advancement will never be finished.

People should not think that we are preaching a sectarian religion.

No.

We are simply preaching how to love God.

There are many theories about the existence of God.

The atheist, for example, will never believe in God.

Atheists like Professor Jacques Monod, who won the Nobel prize, declare that everything is chance (a theory already put forward long ago by atheistic philosophers of India such as Carvaka).

Then other philosophies, such as the karma-mimamsa philosophy, accept that if one goes on doing his work nicely and honestly, automatically the result will come, without need for one to refer to God.

For evidence, the proponents of such theories cite the argument that if one is diseased with an infection and takes medicine to counteract it, the disease will be neutralized.

But our argument in this connection is that even if one gives a man the best medicine, he still may die.

The results are not always predictable.

Therefore, there is a higher authority, daiva-netrena, a supreme director.

Otherwise, how is it that the son of a rich and pious man becomes a hippie in the street or that a man who works very hard and becomes rich is told by his doctor, "Now you may not eat any food, but only barley water"? The karma-mimamsa theory holds that the world is going on without the supreme direction of God.

Such philosophies say that everything takes place by lust (kamahaitukam).

By lust a man becomes attracted to a woman, and by chance there is sex, and the woman becomes pregnant.

There is actually no plan to make the woman pregnant, but by a natural sequence when a man and a woman unite, a result is produced.

The atheistic theory, which is described in the Sixteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita as asuric, or demoniac, is that actually everything is going on in this way, because of chance and resulting from natural attraction.

This demoniac theory supports the idea that if one wants to avoid children, he may use a contraceptive method.

Actually, however, there is a great plan for everything--the Vedic plan.

The Vedic literature gives directions regarding how men and women should unite, how they should beget children, and what the purpose of sex life is.

Krishna says in the Bhagavad-gita that sex life sanctioned by the Vedic order, or sex life under the direction of the Vedic rules and regulations, is bona fide and is acceptable to Him.

But chance sex life is not acceptable.

If by chance one is sexually attracted and there are children, they are called varna-sankara, unwanted population.

That is the way of the lower animals; it is not acceptable for humans.

For humans, there is a plan.

We cannot accept the theory that there is no plan for human life or that everything is born of chance and material necessity.

Sankaracarya's theory that there is no God and that one can go on with his work and imagine God in any form just to keep peace and tranquillity in society is also more or less based on this idea of chance and necessity.

Our way, however, which is completely different, is based on authority.

It is this divine varnasrama-dharma that Krishna recommends, not the caste system as it is understood today.

This modern caste system is now condemned in India also, and it should be condemned, for the classification of different types of men according to birth is not the Vedic or divine caste system.

There are many classes of men in society--some men are engineers, some are medical practitioners, some are chemists, tradesmen, businessmen, and so on.

These varieties of classes are not to be determined by birth, however, but by quality.

No such thing as the caste-by-birth system is sanctioned by the Vedic literature, nor do we accept it.

We have nothing to do with the caste system, which is also at present being rejected by the public in India.

Rather, we give everyone the chance to become a brahmana and thus attain the highest status of life.

Because at the present moment there is a scarcity of brahmanas, spiritual guides, and ksatriyas, administrative men, and because the entire world is being ruled by sudras, or men of the manual laborer class, there are many discrepancies in society.

It is to mitigate all these discrepancies that we have taken to this Krishna consciousness movement.

If the brahmana class is actually reestablished, the other orders of social well-being will automatically follow, just as when the brain is perfectly in order, the other parts of the body, such as the arms, the belly, and the legs, all act very nicely.

The ultimate goal of this movement is to educate people in how to love God.

Caitanya Mahaprabhu approves the conclusion that the highest perfection of human life is to learn how to love God.

The Krishna consciousness movement has nothing to do with the Hindu religion or any system of religion.

No Christian gentleman will be interested in changing his faith from Christian to Hindu.

Similarly, no Hindu gentleman of culture will be ready to change to the Christian faith.

Such changing is for men who have no particular social status.

But everyone will be interested in understanding the philosophy and science of God and taking it seriously.

One should clearly understand that the Krishna consciousness movement is not preaching the so-called Hindu religion.

We are giving a spiritual culture that can solve all the problems of life, and therefore it is being accepted all over the world.
