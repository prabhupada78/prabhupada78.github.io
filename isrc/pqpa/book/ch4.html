<p>February 28, 1972 (continued)</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: This movement is especially meant to enable a human being to reach the real goal of life.</p>
<p>BOB: The real goal ... ?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: The real goal of life.</p>
<p>BOB: Is the real goal of life to know God?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes. To go back home, back to Godhead. That is the real goal of life.</p>
<p>The water that comes from the sea forms clouds, the clouds fall down as rain, and the actual goal is to flow down the river and again enter the sea.</p>
<p>So, we have come from God, and now we are embarrassed by material life.</p>
<p>Therefore, our aim should be to get out of this embarrassing situation and go back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This is the real goal of life.</p>
<p>mām upetya punar janma duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam nāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ [&quot;After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogīs in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.&quot;] That is the version of Bhagavad-gītā.</p>
<p>If anyone comes to Me—mām upetya: he does not come back again.</p>
<p>Where? To this place—duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam.</p>
<p>This place is the abode of miseries.</p>
<p>Everyone knows, but they have been befooled by so-called leaders.</p>
<p>Material life is miserable life.</p>
<p>Kṛṣṇa says, God says, that this place is duḥkhālayam—it is a place of miseries.</p>
<p>And it is also aśāśvatam, temporary.</p>
<p>You cannot make a compromise: &quot;All right, let it be miserable.</p>
<p>I shall remain here as an American or Indian.&quot; No.</p>
<p>That also you cannot do.</p>
<p>You cannot remain an American.</p>
<p>You may think that, having been born in America, you are very happy.</p>
<p>But you cannot remain an American for long.</p>
<p>You will have to be kicked out of that place.</p>
<p>And your next life you do not know! Therefore, it is duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam—miserable and temporary.</p>
<p>That is our philosophy.</p>
<p>BOB: But when you have some knowledge of God, then life is not so miserable?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: No! Some knowledge will not do.</p>
<p>You must have perfect knowledge.</p>
<p>janma karma ca me divyam evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ Tattvataḥ means &quot;perfectly.&quot; Perfect knowledge is being taught in Bhagavad-gītā.</p>
<p>So, we are giving everyone in human society a chance to learn Bhagavad-gītā as it is and make his life perfect.</p>
<p>That is the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</p>
<p>What does your science say about the transmigration of the soul?</p>
<p>BOB: I think ... that science ... cannot deny or affirm it. Science does not know it.</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Therefore I say that science is imperfect.</p>
<p>BOB: Science may, though, say something.</p>
<p>It is said in science that energy is never destroyed; it is changed.</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: That's all right.</p>
<p>But how the energy is working in the future—that science does not know.</p>
<p>How is the energy diverted? How, by different manipulations, is the energy working differently? For instance, electrical energy.</p>
<p>By different handling it is operating the heater, and it is operating the refrigerator.</p>
<p>They are just the opposite, but the electrical energy is the same.</p>
<p>Similarly, this energy—living energy—how is it being directed? Which way is it going? How is it fructifying in the next life? That they do not know.</p>
<p>But in Bhagavad-gītā it is very simply stated.</p>
<p>vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya You are covered by a dress, by a shirt.</p>
<p>When this shirt is unusable, you change it.</p>
<p>Similarly, this body is just like a shirt and coat.</p>
<p>When it is no longer workable, we have to change it.</p>
<p>BOB: What is the &quot;we&quot; that has to change? What is constant?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: That is the soul.</p>
<p>BOB: From one life to the next?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: That is the soul—I.</p>
<p>What &quot;you&quot; is speaking? You! What &quot;I&quot; is speaking? Identity: ātmā, or soul.</p>
<p>BOB: My soul is different from your soul?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes.</p>
<p>You are an individual soul, I am an individual soul.</p>
<p>BOB: You have removed yourself from karmic influences.</p>
<p>If I was to remove myself from karmic influences, would our souls be the same or different?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: The soul is of the same quality in all.</p>
<p>You are under a certain conception of life at the present moment, and these countrymen of yours [the Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees] were under a certain conception of life, but by training they have taken to another conception of life.</p>
<p>So the ultimate training is how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.</p>
<p>That is the perfection.</p>
<p>BOB: If two people are Kṛṣṇa conscious, is their soul the same?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: The soul is always the same.</p>
<p>BOB: In each person? In each person is it the same?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes.</p>
<p>BOB: [pointing to two devotees] If these two are Kṛṣṇa conscious, are their souls the same?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: The soul is the same but always individual, even if one is not Kṛṣṇa conscious.</p>
<p>For instance, you are a human being, and I am a human being.</p>
<p>Even if I am not a Christian, even if you are not a Hindu, still we are human beings.</p>
<p>Similarly, the soul may not be Kṛṣṇa conscious, or he may be Kṛṣṇa conscious—it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>But the soul is the soul.</p>
<p>BOB: Can you tell me more about this?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Soul—as pure spirit, all souls are equal.</p>
<p>Even in an animal.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said, paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ: those who are actually learned do not see the outward covering, either in a human being or in an animal.</p>
<p>BOB: If I may ask another question on this?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes.</p>
<p>BOB: I have considered the soul somewhat as part of God.</p>
<p>At times I think I feel God.</p>
<p>I'm here, and you may say God is here.</p>
<p>So if the soul is inside me, then should I be able to feel God inside me? Not all of God, I mean, but a ...</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Part of God.</p>
<p>BOB: But I don't feel God in me, but God may be here, separate—separate from me.</p>
<p>But should I be able to feel God inside me, since my soul is Part of God?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes.</p>
<p>God is inside also.</p>
<p>God is everywhere.</p>
<p>God is inside and outside also.</p>
<p>This is to be known.</p>
<p>BOB: How do you feel God inside you?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Not in the beginning, but you have to know from the śāstras [scriptures], by the Vedic information.</p>
<p>For example, in the Bhagavad-gītā it is said, īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati: God is there in everyone's heart.</p>
<p>Paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham: God is also within every atom.</p>
<p>So this is the first information.</p>
<p>And then, by the yogic process, you have to realize it.</p>
<p>BOB: Yogic process?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes.</p>
<p>BOB: Is chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa such a yogic process?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes, it is also a yogic process.</p>
<p>BOB: What kind of yogic process must I do to find out—to feel this information— to feel the soul inside?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes, there are many different yogic processes, but for this age this process is very nice.</p>
<p>BOB: Chanting.</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes.</p>
<p>BOB: Through this I can feel not only God outside but God inside?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: You'll understand everything of God—how God is inside, how God is outside, how God is working.</p>
<p>Everything will be revealed.</p>
<p>By this attitude of service, God will reveal Himself.</p>
<p>You cannot understand God by your endeavor.</p>
<p>Only if God reveals Himself.</p>
<p>For instance, when the sun is out of your sight at night, you cannot see it by your torchlight, or any light.</p>
<p>But in the morning you can see the sun automatically, without any torchlight.</p>
<p>Similarly, you have to create a situation—you have to put yourself in a situation—in which God will be revealed.</p>
<p>It is not that by some method you can ask God, &quot;Please come.</p>
<p>I will see You.&quot; No, God is not your order carrier.</p>
<p>BOB: You must please God for Him to reveal Himself.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes.</p>
<p>ŚYĀMASUNDARA: How do we know when we are pleasing God?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: When we see Him.</p>
<p>Then you will understand.</p>
<p>Just as, when you eat, you do not require to ask anyone whether you are feeling strength or your hunger is satisfied.</p>
<p>If you eat, you understand that you are feeling energy.</p>
<p>You don't need to inquire from anyone.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you actually serve God, then you will understand, &quot;God is dictating to me.</p>
<p>God is there.</p>
<p>I am seeing God.&quot;</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: Or God's representative.</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes.</p>
<p>DEVOTEE: It comes easier.</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: You have to go through God's representative.</p>
<p>yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ &quot;By the mercy of the spiritual master one is benedicted by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa.&quot; If you please God's representative, then automatically God becomes pleased, and thus you can directly see Him.</p>
<p>AN INDIAN GENTLEMAN: How to please God's representative?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: You have to carry out his orders, that's all.</p>
<p>God's representative is the guru.</p>
<p>He asks you to do this, to do that—if you do that, that is pleasing.</p>
<p>yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto 'pi &quot;Without the grace of the spiritual master one cannot make any advancement.&quot; If you displease him, then you are nowhere.</p>
<p>Therefore we worship the guru.</p>
<p>sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya vande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam [&quot;The spiritual master is to be honored as much as the Supreme Lord because of his being the most confidential servitor of the Lord.</p>
<p>This is acknowledged by all revealed scriptures and is followed by all authorities.</p>
<p>Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master, who is a bona fide representative of Lord Kṛṣṇa.&quot;] The guru should be accepted as God.</p>
<p>That is the injunction of all śāstra.</p>
<p>BOB: The guru should be accepted as a representative of God?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes, the guru is God's representative.</p>
<p>The guru is the external manifestation of Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>BOB: But different from the incarnations of Kṛṣṇa that come?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes.</p>
<p>BOB: In what way is the external manifestation of the guru different from the external manifestation of, let us say, Kṛṣṇa or Caitanya when They come to earth?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: The guru is the representative of Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>So there are symptoms of who is a guru.</p>
<p>The general symptoms are described in the Vedas.</p>
<p>tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet samit-pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham A guru must come in a disciplic succession, and he must have heard thoroughly about the Vedas from his spiritual master.</p>
<p>Generally a guru's symptom is that he is a perfect devotee, that's all.</p>
<p>And he serves Kṛṣṇa by preaching His message.</p>
<p>BOB: Lord Caitanya—He was a different type of guru than you are?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: No, no.</p>
<p>Gurus cannot be of different types.</p>
<p>All gurus are of one type.</p>
<p>BOB: But He was—was He also an incarnation at the same time?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes, He is Kṛṣṇa Himself, but He is representing the guru.</p>
<p>BOB: I ... I see.</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes.</p>
<p>BOB: And then ...</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Because Kṛṣṇa was God, He demanded: sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja &quot;Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.&quot; But people misunderstood Him.</p>
<p>Therefore Kṛṣṇa again came as a guru and taught people how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>ŚYĀMASUNDARA: Doesn't He say in Bhagavad-gītā, &quot;I am the spiritual master&quot;?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes, He is the original spiritual master because He was accepted as spiritual master by Arjuna.</p>
<p>So what is the difficulty? Śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam.</p>
<p>Arjuna told the Lord, &quot;I am Your disciple, and a soul surrendered unto You.</p>
<p>Please instruct me.&quot; So unless He is a spiritual master, how does Arjuna become His disciple? He is the original guru.</p>
<p>Tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye: &quot;It is He only who first imparted Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmā, the first created being.&quot; Therefore He is the original guru.</p>
<p>BOB: Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes.</p>
<p>He is the original guru.</p>
<p>Then His disciple Brahmā is a guru, then his disciple Nārada is a guru, then his disciple Vyāsa is a guru—in this way there is a guru-paramparā [disciplic succession of gurus].</p>
<p>Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam: the transcendental knowledge is received through the disciplic succession.</p>
<p>BOB: So a guru receives his knowledge through the disciplic succession, not directly from Kṛṣṇa? Do you receive some knowledge directly from Kṛṣṇa?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes.</p>
<p>Kṛṣṇa's direct instruction is there: Bhagavad-gītā.</p>
<p>BOB: I see, but ...</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: But you have to learn it through the disciplic succession, otherwise you will misunderstand it.</p>
<p>BOB: But presently you do not receive information directly from Kṛṣṇa? It comes through the disciplic succession from the books?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: There is no difference.</p>
<p>Suppose I say that this is a pencil.</p>
<p>If you say to him, &quot;There is a pencil,&quot; and if he says to another man, &quot;This is a pencil,&quot; then what is the difference between his instruction and my instructions?</p>
<p>BOB: Kṛṣṇa's mercy allows you to know this now?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: You can take Kṛṣṇa's mercy also, provided it is delivered as it is.</p>
<p>Just as we are teaching Bhagavad-gītā.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gītā Kṛṣṇa says: sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja &quot;Just give up all other forms of religion and simply surrender unto Me.&quot; Now we are saying that you should give up everything and surrender to Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's instruction and our instruction.</p>
<p>There is no deviation.</p>
<p>So if you receive knowledge in that perfect way, that is as good as receiving instruction directly from Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>But we don't change anything.</p>
<p>BOB: When I pray reverently, faithfully, does Kṛṣṇa hear me?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes.</p>
<p>BOB: From me to Him?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Yes, because He is within your heart He is always hearing you—whether you are praying or not praying.</p>
<p>When you are doing some nonsense, He is also hearing you.</p>
<p>And when you pray, that is very good— welcome.</p>
<p>BOB: To Kṛṣṇa's ear, is praying louder than nonsense?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: No.</p>
<p>He is all-perfect.</p>
<p>He can hear everything.</p>
<p>Even if you don't speak, even if you simply think, &quot;I shall do it,&quot; then He hears you.</p>
<p>Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ: Kṛṣṇa is seated in everyone's heart.</p>
<p>BOB: But one should pray—is that so?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: That is his business—praying.</p>
<p>BOB: Whose business?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Every living entity's.</p>
<p>That is the only business.</p>
<p>Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān.</p>
<p>That is the statement of the Vedas.</p>
<p>BOB: What does that mean?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: He supplies everything to everyone.</p>
<p>He is supplying food to everyone.</p>
<p>So He is the Father.</p>
<p>So why should you not pray, &quot;Father, give me this&quot;? Just as in the Christian Bible there is, &quot;Father, give us our daily bread.&quot; That is good—they are accepting the Supreme Father.</p>
<p>But grown-up children should not ask from the father; rather, they should be prepared to serve the father.</p>
<p>That is bhakti [devotion].</p>
<p>BOB: My questions you solve so nicely.</p>
<p>[Everyone laughs with affection.]</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Thank you very much.</p>
<p>BOB: So, should I ask you another question now?</p>
<p>ŚRĪLA PRABHUPĀDA: Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
