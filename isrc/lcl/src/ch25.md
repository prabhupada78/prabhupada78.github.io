# President Jackal

Srila Prabhupada: In Bengal there is a story called jangal-ki raja, concerning a jackal who became king of the forest.

Jackals are known for their cunning.

One day this jackal came into a village and fell into a tub of blue dye.

He fled to the forest, but he had become blue.

So all the animals said, "What is this? What is this? Who is this animal?" Even the lion was surprised: "We have never seen you before, sir.

So who are you?" The jackal replied, "I have been sent by God." So they began to worship him as God.

But then one night some other jackals began to cry: "Wa, wa, wa!" And since jackals cannot restrain themselves from returning the call of their own kind, this blue jackal also began to cry, "Wa, wa, wa!" And thus he exposed himself before all the other animals as being nothing more than a jackal.

Many jackals have been arrested and have resigned from your government.

Brahmananda Swami.

The Watergate affair.

It is called the Watergate scandal.

Srila Prabhupada: Practically speaking, at the present moment no honest man can become a government official.

This is true everywhere.

Unless one is a rogue, a dishonest person, one cannot maintain his governmental position.

Therefore no noble man goes into the government.

But what can you do? Dr.Singh: Politicians are the greatest cheaters.

Srila Prabhupada: Yes, they are scoundrels.

One philosopher said that politics is the last resort of scoundrels.
