# Darwinism Extinct

Srila Prabhupada: This material world is a composition of three qualities--sattva, rajas and tamas (goodness, passion and ignorance)--which are working everywhere.

These three qualities are present in various proportions in all species of life.

For example, some trees produce nice fruit, while others are simply meant for fuel.

This is due to the association of particular qualities of nature.

Among animals also, these three qualities are present.

The cow is in the quality of goodness, the lion in passion, and the monkey in ignorance.

According to Darwin, Darwin's father is a monkey.

[Laughter.] He has theorized foolishly.

Dr.Singh: Darwin has said that some species become extinct in the struggle for survival.

Those which are capable of surviving will survive, but those which are not will become extinct.

So he says survival and extinction go side by side.

Srila Prabhupada: Nothing is extinct.

The monkey is not extinct.

Darwin's immediate forefather, the monkey, is still existing.

Karandhara: Darwin said there must be a natural selection.

But selection means choice.

So who is choosing? Srila Prabhupada: That must be a person.

Who is allowing someone to survive and someone to be killed? There must be some authority with discretion to give such an order.

That is our first proposition.

Who that authority is, is explained in Bhagavad-gita.

Krsna says, mayadhyaksena prakrtih: "Nature is working under My supervision." (Bg.9.10) Dr.Singh: Darwin also says that the different species were not created simultaneously, but evolved gradually.

Srila Prabhupada: Then what is his explanation for how the process of evolution began? Karandhara: Modern proponents of Darwinism say that the first living organism was created chemically.

Srila Prabhupada: And I say to them, "If life originated from chemicals, and if your science is so advanced, then why can't you create life biochemically in your laboratories?"
