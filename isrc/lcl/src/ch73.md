# Accepting Knowledge From a Learned Person

Dr.Singh: Srila Prabhupada, many people have difficulty accepting God.

Srila Prabhupada: They are diseased, but they do not want to be treated.

If they do not agree to be treated, that is their fault.

One who is not Krsna conscious--God conscious--is a madman.

Under the power of the illusory energy--the inferior, material energy--he talks only nonsense, just like someone haunted by a ghost.

You must approach a person who is learned.

You must find such a person, a guru, and surrender to him.

Then question him, and whatever answers you get from him you must accept.

That is the process for understanding God.

You must first find the guru; then you must satisfy him by service and by surrendering unto him.

The guru will explain everything.

Krsna explains in Bhagavad-gita (4.34): tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya upadeksyanti te jnanam jnaninas tattva-darsinah "Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.

Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him.

The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth."
