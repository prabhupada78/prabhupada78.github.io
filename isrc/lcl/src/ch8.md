# In the Future

Karandhara: They say they will create life in the future.

Srila Prabhupada: What future? When this crucial point is raised, they reply, "We shall do it in the future." Why in the future? That is nonsense.

"Trust no future, however pleasant." If they are so advanced, they must demonstrate now how life can be created from chemicals.

Otherwise what is the meaning of their advancement? They are talking nonsense.

Karandhara: They say that they are right on the verge of creating life.

Srila Prabhupada: That's only a different way of saying the same thing: "In the future." The scientists must admit that they still do not know the origin of life.

Their claim that they will soon prove a chemical origin of life is something like paying someone with a postdated check.

Suppose I give you a postdated check for ten thousand dollars but I actually have no money.

What is the value of that check? Scientists are claiming that their science is wonderful, but when a practical example is wanted, they say they will provide it in the future.

Suppose I say that I possess millions of dollars, and when you ask me for some money I say, "Yes, I will now give you a big postdated check.

Is that all right?" If you are intelligent, you will reply, "At present give me at least five dollars in cash so I can see something tangible." Similarly, the scientists cannot produce even a single blade of grass in their laboratories, yet they are claiming that life is produced from chemicals.

What is this nonsense? Is no one questioning this? Karandhara: They say that life is produced by chemical laws.

Srila Prabhupada: As soon as there is a law, we must take into consideration that someone made the law.

Despite all their so-called advancement, the scientists in their laboratories cannot produce even a blade of grass.

What kind of scientists are they? Dr.Singh: They say that in the ultimate analysis, everything came from matter.

Living matter came from nonliving matter.

Srila Prabhupada: Then where is this living matter coming from now? Do the scientists say that life came from matter in the past but does not at the present? Where is the ant coming from now--from the dirt?
