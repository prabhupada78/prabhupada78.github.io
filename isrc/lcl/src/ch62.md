# Satisfied Animals

Dr.Wolf-Rottkay: Because our senses are defective, the technological enlargements of our senses must also be defective, of course.

Dr.Singh: The microscopes with which we detect things must also be defective.

Srila Prabhupada: Material existence means defective existence.

If you construct something with defective knowledge and imperfect senses, whatever you construct must be defective.

Dr.Singh: Even if scientists devised a perfect microscope, they would still have to look through it with defective eyes.

Srila Prabhupada: Yes.

That is right.

Therefore we conclude that whatever the scientists may say is defective.

Dr.Singh: But they seem quite satisfied.

Srila Prabhupada: The ass is also satisfied.

The ass is satisfied to carry the load of the washerman.

Everyone is satisfied, even the worm in the stool.

That is nature's law.

Dr.Wolf-Rottkay: It is said that even the pauper is proud of his penny.

Srila Prabhupada: Yes.

In some parts of India one may sometimes see a dog starving to death.

But as soon as it gets a female dog, it is satisfied with having sex.

Is that satisfaction? The dog is starving, but still it is satisfied with sex.
